<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments of $organism mRNAs from the
<a href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/" target="_blank">Mammalian Gene Collection</a>
(MGC) having full-length open reading frames (ORFs) to the genome.
The goal of the Mammalian Gene Collection is to provide researchers with
unrestricted access to sequence-validated full-length protein-coding cDNA
clones for human, mouse, and rat genes.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
The track follows the display conventions for
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay" target="_blank">gene prediction
tracks</a>.
</p>

<p>
An optional codon coloring feature is available for quick
validation and comparison of gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. For more information
about this feature, go to the
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html" target="_blank">
Coloring Gene Predictions and Annotations by Codon</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
GenBank $organism MGC mRNAs identified as having full-length ORFs
were aligned against the genome using blat. When a single mRNA
aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base identity was
found.  Only alignments having a base identity level within 1% of
the best and at least 95% base identity with the genomic sequence
were kept.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
The $organism MGC full-length mRNA track was produced at UCSC from
mRNA sequence data submitted to
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank">
GenBank</a> by the Mammalian Gene Collection project.
