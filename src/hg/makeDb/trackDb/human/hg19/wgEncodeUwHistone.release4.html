<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track was produced as part of the ENCODE Project.
This track displays genome-wide maps of histone modifications in different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>
using ChIP-seq high-throughput sequencing.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
<P>
For each cell type, this track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>HotSpots</I>
<DD> ChIP-seq affinity zones identified using the HotSpot algorithm.
<DT><I>Peaks</I>
<DD> ChIP-seq affinity sites identified as signal peaks within
FDR 1.0% affinity zones.
<DT><I>Raw Signal</I>
<DD> The density of tags mapping within a 150 bp sliding window
(at a 20 bp step across the genome).
</DL>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and the reaction was quenched
by the addition of glycine. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed in nuclei
lysis buffer, and the chromatin was sheared to 200-500 bp fragments using a
Fisher Dismembrator (model 500). Sheared chromatin fragments were
immunoprecipitated with specific polyclonal antibodies at 4 &#176;C
with gentle rotation. Antibody-chromatin complexes were washed and eluted.
The cross-linking in the immunoprecipitated DNA was reversed and treated with
RNase-A.  Following proteinase K treatment, the DNA fragments were purified
by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation.
A quantity of 20-50 ng of ChIP DNA was end-repaired, followed by the addition of adenine,
ligation to Illumina adapters, and creation of a Solexa library for sequencing.
<P>
ChIP-seq affinity was directly measured through the
raw tag density (<I>Raw Signal</I>), which is shown in the track as density of tags
mapping within a 150 bp sliding window (at a 20 bp step across the genome).
ChIP-seq affinity zones (<I>HotSpots</I>) were identified using the
HotSpot algorithm described in Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> (2004).
One percent false discovery rate thresholds (FDR 1.0%) were computed for each cell type by
applying the HotSpot algorithm to an equivalent number of random
uniquely mapping 36-mers. ChIP-Seq affinities  (<I>Peaks</I>)
were identified as signal peaks within FDR 1.0% hypersensitive
zones using a peak-finding algorithm.
</P>
<p>
All tracks have a False Discovery Rate of 1% (FDR 1.0%).

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>
Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying a correlation
coefficient &gt; 0.9.
