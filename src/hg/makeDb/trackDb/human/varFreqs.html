<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This container shows results from projects
where the variant frequencies, aka allele frequencies, are publicly available. The tracks were collected from the 
projects listed below. Projects that provide haplotype-phased genotypes/variants can be found
elsewhere: 1000 Genomes is a separate track, and the projects HGDP, SGDP,
HGDP+1000 Genomes and Mexico Biobank can be found in the "Phased Variants" track.
</p>
<p>If you want us to add other projects, please contact us. We asked and were
unable to obtain variant frequencies from the following projects: UK Biobank (request pending), All of us (granted),
SFARI SPARK (in process).
</p>

The following projects were added:

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>

<p>Most tracks only show the variant and allele frequencies on mouseover or clicks.
When zoomed in, tracks display alleles with base-specific coloring. Homozygote
data are shown as one letter, while heterozygotes will be displayed with both
letters.
</p>

<p>
For <b>NCBI ALFA:</b> This track has no single VCF with INFO fields, but uses multiple subtracks
instead, one per ancestry.
</p>


<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>Most of the data in these tracks are not available for download from UCSC.
Data can be browsed on our website.
But the data can be downloaded
for free from the original projects. Accessing the

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
<b>MXB:</b> Genotyping was performed with the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Global Array
(MEGA, ~1.8M SNPs), optimized for admixed populations and enriched for
ancestry-informative and medically relevant variants. Only autosomal, biallelic
SNPs passing quality control are included. Samples were selected from 898
recruitment sites, with prioritization of indigenous language speakers. Data
processing included GenomeStudio &rarr; PLINK conversion, strand alignment, removal
of duplicates, update of map positions using dbSNP Build 151 and low-quality
variants/individuals, and relatedness filtering.
</p>
<p>
<b>SGDP:</b> The version used was
<a target="_blank" href="https://sharehost.hms.harvard.edu/genetics/reich_lab/sgdp/vcf_variants/"
>https://sharehost.hms.harvard.edu/genetics/reich_lab/sgdp/vcf_variants/</a>,
merged with bcftools and lifted to hg38 with CrossMap. 
</p>
<p>
<b>KOVA:</b> V7 of the TSV.gz was obtained from the KOVA staff and converted to VCF. It is not
available for download from our site but can be requested from the KOVA website.
</p>

<p><b>Finngen:</b> R12 was downloaded from https://finngen.gitbook.io/documentation/data-download and converted to VCF with a Python script. </p>

<p><b>NPM Singapore:</b> Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data processing followed
GATK4 best practices. GATK4 germline variant analysis workflow written in WDL
was adapted to use Nextflow and deployed at the National Supercomputing Centre,
Singapore (NSCC). In short, WGS reads were aligned against GRCh38 using the
BWA-MEM algorithm and used as input to GATK HaplotypeCaller to produce single
sample gVCFs. The gVCF files were joint-called then loaded in Hail, an
open-source python-based data analysis library suited to work with
population-scale with genomic data collections. Low-quality WGS libraries and
low-quality variants were removed.  QC-ed variants were functionally annotated
using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (version 95). Functional
annotations for variant impacting protein-coding were also complemented with
information on the potential alteration to their cognate protein's 3D structure
and drug binding ability.
