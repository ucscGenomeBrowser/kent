<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a collection of the HA gene sequences of all human H1N1 (including the swine
flu) viruses downloaded from the GISAID EpiFlu Database on 4/26/09</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A set of all human H1N1 DNA sequences were downloaded from the GISAID EpiFlu
Database.  These sequences are aligned to the H1N1 base genome using BLAT.
The resulting high scoring (>500) alignments were used to create this track in PSL format.
</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
