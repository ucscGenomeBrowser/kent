<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows protein sequences recognized by antibodies 
as annotated by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
<a href="http://iedb.org" target="_blank">Immune Epitope Database</a> (IEDB). 
Only sequences with a positive assay outcome are shown on the track. All fields annotated by
IEDB and exported in their &quot;compact&quot; file are shown on the details page, which also 
provides links back to the IEDB.  </p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
Peptide matches are labeled with the name of the antibody and the host organism, separated by a 
slash.
When the antibody does not have a name in IEDB, the first six letters of the peptide are shown 
instead.
