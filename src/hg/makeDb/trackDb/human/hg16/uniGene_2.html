<H2>Description</H2> 
<P>
Serial analysis of gene expression (<A HREF="http://www.sagenet.org/"
TARGET=_blank>SAGE</A>)
is a quantitative measurement of gene expression. Data are presented for every
cluster contained in the browser window and the selected cluster name is 
highlighted in the table. All data are from the repository at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/" TARGET=_blank>SageMap</A> project
built on UniGene version Hs 162. Click on a UniGene cluster name on the track
details page to display SageMap's page for that cluster. Please note that data 
are not available for every cluster. There is no data available for clusters
that lie entirely within the bounds of larger clusters.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
SAGE counts are produced by sequencing small &quot;tags&quot; of DNA believed 
to be associated with a gene. These tags were generated by attaching 
poly-A RNA to oligo-dT beads. After synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, 
transcripts were cleaved by an anchoring enzyme (usually NlaIII). Then, small 
tags were produced by ligation with a linker containing a type IIS restriction
enzyme site and cleavage with the tagging enzyme (usually BsmFI). The 
tags were concatenated together and sequenced. The frequency of each 
tag was counted and used to infer expression level of transcripts that could
be matched to that tag. </P>

All SAGE data presented here were mapped to UniGene transcripts by the 
SageMap project at NCBI. </P>
