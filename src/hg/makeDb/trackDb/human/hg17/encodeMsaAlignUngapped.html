<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the number of species aligned to the human genome in the
ENCODE regions in which the alignment does not contain a gap at a particular 
human base position. 
The multiple species alignments, which were generated by the programs 
MAVID, MLAGAN and TBA (v2), are taken from the Sep. 2005 ENCODE MSA freeze. 
</P>
<P>
This track, which complements the MSA Alignment Agreement track (Align 
Agree), is useful for distinguishing between agreements in which both programs
align the human base to the same base in another species and those instances
in which both align the human base to a gap in the other species. </P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.
