<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The miRNA track shows microRNAs from the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/" TARGET=_blank>
miRNA Registry</A> at <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>The 
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>. Mature miRNAs (miRs) are represented by 
thick lines; the predicted stem-loop portions of the primary transcripts
are indicated by thinner lines. miRNAs in the sense orientation are shown in
black; those in the reverse orientation are colored grey. When a single 
precursor produces two mature miRs from its 5' and 3' parts, it is displayed 
twice with the two different positions of the mature miR.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Mature and precursor miRNAs from the miRNA Registry are
aligned against the genome using
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>.
The extents of the precursor sequences are not generally known, and are
predicted based on base-paired hairpin structure.  The miRNA Registry is
described in Griffiths-Jones, S.
