<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
Inside the nucleus, DNA is wrapped into a complex molecular structure
called chromatin, whose fundamental unit is approximately 150bp of DNA
organized around the eight-histone protein complex known as the
nucleosome.  This track contains predicted nucleosome occupancy scores
produced by a model that was trained  using data from the MEC cell line
from Ozsolak et al. (2007).  This cell line was prepared with strong
MNase digestion.  This model excels at recognizing regions of high
accessibility to MNase cleavage; i.e., positions that are frequently
nucleosome-free.


<h1>Display Conventions and Configuration</h1>

<p>
The output of the SVM is a unitless discriminant score.  In the
browser, the score of a 50-mer is assigned to its 26th base.
Canonically, a score of 0 indicates an uncertain assignment; a score
of 1.0 corresponds to a confident prediction for being in the positive
class (i.e., a position of frequent nucleosome occupancy), and a score
of -1.0 corresponds to a confident prediction for being in the
negative class.</p>

<h1>Methods</h1>

<p>For a given microarray experiment, we identify the 1000 50bp probes
with the highest log intensity ratios.  These comprise our positive
training samples.  In a similar fashion, we generate negative training
samples with the lowest log intensity ratios.  Each 50-mer in the
training set is converted into a 2772-element vector of k-mer
frequencies for <i>k</i>=1 up to 6 (collapsing reverse complements).
A linear SVM is then trained to discriminate between the two classes.
The SVM regularization parameter is selected by evaluating the entire
regularization path on a held-out portion of the training data set.
After training, each 50-mer in the human genome is converted to the
2772-element representation and scored using the trained SVM.</p>
