<A HREF ="http://baboon.math.berkeley.edu/~syntenic/about.html" TARGET=_blank>Slam</A> predicts coding exons and conserved noncoding regions in a pair of
homologous DNA sequences, incorporating both statistical sequence properties
and degree of conservation into predictions.  This particular annotation uses the Feb. 2002 (mm2) assembly of the mouse genome. The model is symmetric and the same gene structure (with possibly different exon lengths) is predicted in both sequences. 

<P>
The CNS (conserved non-coding sequence) predictions are ab-initio
predictions of conserved regions that do not fit in with a gene structure.
Thus, slam is not simply trying to predict conserved regions to be coding,
but is classifying such regions according to an overall probabilistic model
of gene structure. The set of slam CNS predictions is therefore highly
enriched for conserved <b>non-coding</b> regions.
