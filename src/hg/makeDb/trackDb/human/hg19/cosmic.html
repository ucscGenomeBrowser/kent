<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/" target="_blank">COSMIC</a>, 
the "Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer," is an online database of somatic mutations found in 
human cancer. Focused exclusively on non-inherited acquired mutations, COSMIC combines information 
from a range of sources, curating the described relationships between cancer phenotypes and gene 
(and genomic) mutations. This data is then made available in a number of ways including here in the 
UCSC genome browser, on the COSMIC website with custom analytical tools, via a federated 
<a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/biomart/martview/" target="_blank">Biomart</a>, or offline via
datasheets downloaded from the <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/CGP/cosmic" target="_blank">FTP site</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The data in COSMIC is curated from a number of high-quality sources and combined into a single
resource. The sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed journal articles</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/cancergenome/" target="_blank">CGP laboratories at the Sanger
Institute, UK</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/" target="_blank">TCGA data portal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dcc.icgc.org/web/" target="_blank">The ICGC data portal</a></li>
<li><a href="http://p53.iarc.fr/" target="_blank">IARC p53 database</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Information on known cancer genes, selected from the <a
href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/census/" target="_blank">Cancer Gene Census</a> is curated manually to
maximise its descriptive content. Data from large scale systematic screens are curated 
semi-automatically, using Vagrent software to reannotate mutant genomic positions (version 0.1 is 
described at <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/vagrent/" target="_blank">VAGrENT: Variation 
Annotation Generator</a>). The full curated dataset is exported from the COSMIC database in CSV 
format for uploading to UCSC for each bimonthly release; this file is also available on the COSMIC
FTP site.</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dense - Indicate the positions where COSMIC mutations have been annotated in a single horizontal
track</li>
<li>Squish - Indicate each mutation, in vertical pileups where appropriate, whilst minimizing screen
 space used.</li>
<li>Pack - Indicate each mutation with COSMIC identifier (COSMnnnnn), mutation annotation,
overall mutation frequency and tissues affected, with a link to further details.</li>
<li>Full - Show each mutation in detail, one per line, with COSM identifier, mutation annotation,
overall mutation frequency and tissues affected, with a link to even further details.</li>
</ul>
