The November 2003 zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) Zv3 assembly was 
produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with 
the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, 
Germany, and the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology 
(Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The Netherlands. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an mRNA 
or EST, a scaffold range, an Ensembl transcript ID, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides 
examples of various types of position queries for the zebrafish 
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. "huntington") may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the 
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in zebrafish.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html"
TARGET=_blank>User Guide</A> for more help.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
This assembly was constructed by using two different strategies. In the first, 
a whole genome shotgun (WGS) approach was used.  DNA from 1000 five-day-old 
Tuebingen embryos was used to generate plasmid and fosmid libraries. The 
libraries were sequenced and the resulting traces were assembled with the 
Sanger Institute assembler, Phusion. The second approach used traditional 
clone mapping and sequencing techniques to produce a higher quality genome 
sequence. BAC libraries were selected and 
fingerprinted to generate an FPC map. From this map, a tiling path was calculated
that covers the genome sequence clone-by-clone. Clones from this path were 
selected for high quality sequencing and then 
pieced together to form the genome sequence. 
<P>
The Zv3 assembly consists of 1,459,115,486 bp in 58,339 supercontigs, with a 
sequence coverage of approximately 5.7X. This zebrafish assembly is the first 
to be tied to the FPC map: 1,083,447,588 bp (74%) of the sequence were mapped
in this way. 
<P>
The Sanger Institute notes that this is a preliminary assembly; a high 
level of misassembly is present due to polymorphisms in the DNA source.  Highly 
variable regions of the assembly are difficult to assemble,
most likely due to differing haplotypes.
