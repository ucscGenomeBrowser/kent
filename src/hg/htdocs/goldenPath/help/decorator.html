<h1>Track Decorators</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Track decorators allow highlighting parts of features with colors and/or symbols (glyphs/shapes)
within a single track. The decorations can either be overlaid onto the feature or shown directly
underneath. Decorators can be added to <b>BED 12+</b>, <b>bigBed</b>, <b>PSL</b>, and
<b>bigGenePred</b> tracks. To add decorations to a track, the decorations must first be stored in a
separate bigBed file that includes extra fields to identify the decorated items. The track settings
for the track must then be modified to include a pointer to that bigBed file; this can be done
either in the track line for a custom track, or in the trackDb.txt file for a hub.</p>

<h2>Annotating the Genome</h2>
<p>The genome browser&lsquo;s primary way to annotate the genome uses colored rectangles
(&quot;exons&quot; for gene tracks) linked by thin lines (&quot;introns&quot;), often stored as
a bigBed. These were originally used for genes but then evolved to cover other types of annotations,
e.g. enhancers, chromatin modifications, or single nucleotide variants. We usually call these
annotations &quot;features&quot;. Each rectangle (&quot;exon&quot;) of a feature has the same
color and individual parts cannot be highlighted. If you wanted to highlight parts of the features,
traditionally this required a second track.</p>
<div class="text-center">
        <img src="../../images/runx2.png" style="width:80%;max-width:1083px">
</div>

<p>
A track decorator is more compact than creating a separate track for these sub-features, but loses
some of the abilities of normal tracks, for example, there is no right-click on the sub-features
and the user cannot click these sub-features. The primary use case driving this display was
protein-domains drawn on top of gene models, but we have found many other applications since then,
e.g. drawing summits on ATAC peaks or highlighting selenocysteines on transcripts.</p>
<p>


<a id="styles"></a>
<h2>The Decorator Styles</h2>
<p>Track decorators can be shown in two styles, &quot;block&quot; and &quot;glyph&quot; style. The
&quot;block&quot; style option can be used to color exons and introns and can display a label for
them. For example, the &quot;block&quot; track decorator could be used to overlay protein domain
boundaries on transcripts where usually one would use an entirely different track for the domains.
</p>
<div class="text-center">
        <img src="../../images/runx2_decorator.png" style="width:80%;max-width:1083px">
</div>

<p>The &quot;glyph&quot; style option offers 8 different types of glyphs and the color of choice.
</p>
<div class="text-center">
        <img src="../../images/glyphsEx.png" style="width:40%;max-width:1083px">
</div>
<p>The &quot;glyph&quot; style option can be used to draw entirely new symbols, for example, to
indicate insertion positions on the genome with small triangles. We appreciate user feedback. If
you have glyph questions, glyph style requests, or have found new glyph applications, please
contact our <a href="mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu">mailing list</a>.
<p>To use decorators in your track hub or custom tracks, you will need to create an additional bigBed
file that defines the regions, colors, and glyphs.</p>

<a id="gettingStarted"></a>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
<a name="decoratorBigBed"></a>
<h3>The Decorator bigBed</h3>
<p>
A decorator bigBed file, which contains decorations for annotating another track, is very similar
to our standard <a href="bigBed.html">bigBed file format</a>.  The only difference is the addition
of some extra required fields, which describe how each decoration should be drawn and what item
within that other track it annotates.
<p>
The full .as format for decorator bigBed files is as follows:
<pre>
    string chrom;      "Chromosome (or contig, scaffold, etc.)"
    uint   chromStart; "Start position in chromosome"
    uint   chromEnd;   "End position in chromosome"
    string name;       "Name of item"
    uint   score;      "Score from 0-1000"
    char[1] strand;    "+ or -"
    uint thickStart;   "Start of where display should be thick (start codon)"
    uint thickEnd;     "End of where display should be thick (stop codon)"
    uint color;        "Primary RGB color for the decoration"
    int blockCount;    "Number of blocks"
    int[blockCount] blockSizes; "Comma separated list of block sizes"
    int[blockCount] chromStarts; "Start positions relative to chromStart"
    string decoratedItem; "Identity of the decorated item in chr:start-end:item_name format"
    string style;      "Draw style for the decoration (e.g. block, glyph)"
    string fillColor;  "Secondary color to use for filling decoration, blocks, supports RGBA"
    string glyph;  "The glyph to draw in glyph mode; ignored for other styles"
</pre>
<p>
A copy of this file can be found <a href="examples/decorator/decoration.as">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Valid values for the style field are "block" and "glyph".  Valid glyph entries include "Circle",
"Square", "Diamond", "Triangle", "InvTriangle", "Octagon", "Star", "X", and "Pentagram". 
For non-glyph mode, the text can be the text string "Ignored". If the text isn't
recognized, Circle will be used by default.</p>
<p>
The "decoratedItem" field (chr:start-end:item_name format) captures the link between the decoration and what item in the track is being
decorated.  The contents of this field must be the chromosome, BED start coordinate, BED end coordinate,
and item name for the decorated item (note - these are 0-based half-open BED coordinates, not 1-based
fully closed coordinates.  That means they are the same values as should appear in a BED file describing
the decorated item).

<a id="examples"></a>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<a id="example1"></a>
<h3>Example &num;1: Building a decorator bigBed</h3>
<p>
Here is an example of how to use this format. Consider the item in BED format as a &quot;feature&quot;:
<pre>
chr1 1000 2000 feature 0 + 1000 2000 0 2 400,400 0,600
</pre>
<p>
We can take this <a href="examples/decorator/mainEx.bed">BED file</a> and construct a
<a href="examples/decorator/mainEx.bb">mainEx.bb</a> from it as described in the <a href="bigBed.html">bigBed</a>
documentation. To add a decoration to the &quot;feature&quot; item that annotates the region at position
chr1:1,201-1,800, we could create a corresponding item in a decorator bed file like the following:
</p>
<pre>
chr1 1200 1800 highlight 0 + 1200 1800 255,0,0,255 1 600 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature block 255,0,0,128 Ignored
</pre>
<ul>
   <li>The name of this decorator item is <code>highlight</code> specified in the fourth field of the
       decorator bed file.</li>
   <li>The 9th field of the decorator bed file (255,0,0,255) specifies the decoration outline using
       RGB values and an alpha value to control opacity.</li>
   <li>The <code>chr1:1000-2000:feature</code> (13th field of the decorator bed file) entry describes
       which item in the main bed file is to be annotated. In this case, it's an item with the name
       &quot;feature&quot; at position chr1:1,001-2,000.</li>
   <li>The 15th field of the decorator bed file (255,0,0,128) specifies the interior of the decoration using RGB
       values and an alpha value to control opacity.</li>
   <li>The <code>Ignored</code> value is used in the last field of the bed file because we are
        creating a block decoration (a decoration that annotates a range of bases).</li>
</ul>
<p>
To add a glyph decoration that marks the final base of the transcript with a green circle, we would
then include the following line in the decorator bed file:</p>
<pre>
chr1 1999 2000 green_circle 0 + 1999 2000 0,255,0,255 1 1 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature glyph 0,255,0,255 Circle
</pre>
<ul>
   <li>The name of this decorator item is <code>green_circle</code> specified in the fourth field of the
       decorator bed file.</li>
   <li>The 9th field of the decorator bed file (0,255,0,255) specifies the decoration outline using
       RGB values and an alpha value to control opacity.</li>
   <li>The <code>chr1:1000-2000:feature</code> (13th field of the decorator bed file) entry describes
       which item in the main bed file is to be annotated.</li>
   <li>The 15th field of the decorator bed file (0,255,0,255) specifies the interior of the decoration using RGB
       values and an alpha value to control opacity.</li>
   <li>The <code>Circle</code> glyph style is specified in the last field of the decorator bed file.</li>
</ul>
</pre>
<p>
Both of these bed decorations can be stored in a file named
<a href="examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bed">decoratorsEx.bed</a> and then built as a 
<a href="examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb">decoratorsEx.bb</a> using the
<a href="hg38.chrom.sizes"><em>hg38.chrom.sizes</em></a> and the
<a href="examples/decorator/decoration.as">decoration.as</a> files and running the following
command:</p>
<pre>bedToBigBed -type=bed12+ -as=decoration.as decoratorsEx.bed hg38.chrom.sizes decoratorsEx.bb
</pre>

<h6>Debugging the decorator bigBed</h6>

<p>
The resulting <a href="examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb">decoratorsEx.bb</a> file can be
displayed as a stand-alone custom track for debugging purposes. This process allows verification
that the decorations are correctly applied. To display the decorator bigBed, navigate to the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgCustom"
target="_blank">UCSC Genome Browser Custom Tracks page</a> and paste the URL into the designated
text field:</p>
<pre>browser position chr1:1000-2000
https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb
</pre>

<p>Once the decorator bigBed is loaded, the decorations will be rendered on the UCSC Genome
Browser, allowing for verification of the correct display.</p>

<a id="example2"></a>
<a name="Example2"></a>
<h3>Example &num;2: Create a custom track </h3>
<p>Create a decorator bigBed custom track using the decorator bigBed file from Example #1.</p>
 <ol>
   <li>
   Construct a track line that references the <a href="examples/decorator/mainEx.bb">bigBed</a>
   and the <a href="examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb">decorator bigBed file</a>:</p>
   <pre>browser position chr1:1000-2000
track type=bigBed name=&quot;Decorators Example Two&quot; description=&quot;bigBed with decorators&quot; visibility=pack bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/mainEx.bb decorator.default.bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb</pre>
  <li>
  Paste the track line into the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom?db=hg38">custom track
  page</a> for the human assembly, hg38.</li>
  <li>
  Click the <button>Submit</button> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Custom tracks can also be loaded via one URL line. The link below loads the same bigBed with decorators track
and sets additional parameters in the URL:</p>
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&hgct_customText=track%20type=bigBed%20bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/mainEx.bb%20decorator.default.bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb&position=chr1:1000-2000"
target="_blank"><pre>https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&amp;hgct_customText=track%20type=bigBed%20bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/mainEx.bb%20decorator.default.bigDataUrl=https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/decoratorsEx.bb&amp;position=chr1:1000-2000
</pre></a>

<a id="example3"></a>
<a name="Example3"></a>
<h3>Example &num;3: Create a decorator bigBed with extra (custom) fields</h3>

<p>Additional fields can also be added onto the end of the .as file, though they will not be used by
default. The additional fields can be used for custom feature filters and mouseOvers options. For
example, to set up a
<a href="hubQuickStartFilter.html#filterValues">filterValues filter</a>, you would add the
following two fields to the decoration.as file:</p>
<pre>
    int numKeywords;  "Number of keywords"
    string[numKeywords] keywords;  "Keywords for this decorator"
</pre>
<p>The <code>numKeywords</code> field specifies the number of keywords and the <code>keywords</code> field specifies the
keywords. You would then modify your decoratorsEx.bed file to include an additional fields at the
end of each line, detailing which keywords apply to each of the decorations:</p>
<pre>
chr1 1200 1800 highlight 0 + 1200 1800 255,0,0,255 1 600 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature block 255,0,0,128 Ignored 1 Type1
chr1 1999 2000 green_circle 0 + 1999 2000 0,255,0,255 1 1 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature glyph 0,255,0,255 Circle 2 Type2,Type3
</pre>
<p>The first bed entry filters for one class &quot;Type1&quot; and the second bed entry filters for
two classes &quot;Type2,Type3&quot;.</p> 
<p>You can also add a <a href="trackDb/trackDbDoc.html#mouseOverField">mouseOverField</a> 
which will allow you to mouse over text that is different from the &quot;name&quot; of the
decorator bigBed. You would add the following field to the decoration.as file:</p>
<pre>
    string mouseOverField;  "Mouse over text"
</pre>
<p>Then modify your decoratorsEx.bed file to include the additional field.
<pre>
chr1 1200 1800 highlight 0 + 1200 1800 255,0,0,255 1 600 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature block 255,0,0,128 Ignored 1 Type1 alternate_highlight_name
chr1 1999 2000 green_circle 0 + 1999 2000 0,255,0,255 1 1 0 chr1:1000-2000:feature glyph 0,255,0,255 Circle 2 Type2,Type3 alternate_green_circle_name
</pre>
<p>You would then rebuild the decorations.bb file using the
<a href="examples/decorator/decoration.as">decorationEx_fields.as</a> with extra fields:
</p>
<pre>bedToBigBed -type=bed12+ -as=decorationEx_fields.as decoratorsEx.bed hg38.chrom.sizes decoratorsEx.bb
</pre>

<a id="hub"></a>
<h2>Hub TrackDb Settings</h2>
<p>
The statement below provides trackDb settings to add decorators to a track hub:</p>
<pre>
track testTrack
type bigBed 12
bigDataUrl https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/mainEx.bb
itemRgb on
decorator.default.bigDataUrl https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/examples/decorator/decorationsEx.bb
</pre>

<ul>
   <li>The <b>type</b> can be BED 12+, bigBed, PSL, and bigGenePred tracks.</li>
   <li>The <b>bigDataUrl</b> is the main file to be annotated for decorators.</li>
   <li>The <b>itemRgb</b> setting allows the coloring of the interior of the block
       decorators.</li>
   <li>The <b>decorator.default.bigDataUrl</b> setting adds decorations to the track and will point
       to the bigBed file containing the decorators.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other settings are available to further configure decorators. Each may be applied to the decorator
instead of the primary track by prepending "decorator.default." to the setting. For example, to set
up a <a href="hubQuickStartFilter.html#filterValues">filterValues filter</a> on the
&quot;keywords&quot; field of the decorator, allowing the user to filter to any combination of
three classes &quot;Type1&quot;, &quot;Type2&quot;, and &quot;Type3&quot;, the following trackDb
entry could be used were the <b>multipleListOr</b> setting splits the three classes list values by
commas:
<pre>
decorator.default.filterValues.keywords Type1,Type2,Type3
decorator.default.filterType.keywords multipleListOr
</pre>
<p>
Please note that this would also require building an extra <code>keywords</code> field into the decorator
bigBed to hold those values, see Example #3 for more details.</p>
<p>Decorators also support the <a href="trackDb/trackDbDoc.html#mouseOver">mouseOver</a> and
<a href="trackDb/trackDbDoc.html#mouseOverField">mouseOverField</a> settings that can be applied to
bigBed tracks:</p>
<pre>
decorator.default.mouseOver decorator $name mouseOver
decorator.default.mouseOver $mouseOver
</pre>
<p>
You can configure the block decoration placement visibility to &quot;overlay&quot;,
&quot;adjacent&quot;, or &quot;hide&quot; using the <b>blockMode</b>
setting:</p>
<pre>
decorator.default.blockMode adjacent
</pre>
<p>
You can use the <b>maxLabelBases</b> setting to set a maximum window size (in bases) for which labels
will be drawn. If not set, the value will default to 200kb. This can be useful to deactivate
decoration labels when there are too many track items and too many decoration labels to process
visually.</p> 
<pre>
decorator.default.maxLabelBases 100000
</pre>
<p> A full list of supported decorator
settings is available in the
<a href="trackDb/trackDbDoc.html#decorator">trackDb documentation</a>.</p>

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
If you get an error when you run the <code>bedToBigBed</code> program, please check your input BED file for
data coordinates that extend past the end of the chromosome. If these are present, run the
<code>bedClip</code> program
(<a href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">available here</a>) to remove the problematic
row(s) in your input BED file before using the <code>bedToBigBed</code> program.
