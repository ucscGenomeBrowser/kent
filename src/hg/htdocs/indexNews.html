        	<FONT FACE="courier" SIZE="3"><B>7 November 2011 - UMD Cow
		Assembly Now Available in Genome Browser</B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    In response to the many requests from the bovine research
		    community, we now offer the University of Maryland (UMD)
		    <em>Bos taurus</em> assembly in the Genome Browser, in 
		    addition to the assemblies produced by the Baylor College 
		    of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center. The UMD v3.1 
		    assembly (Nov. 2009, UCSC bosTau6) was produced by the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/" TARGET=_blank>UMD Center 
		    for Bioinformatics and Computational 
		    Biology</A> (CBCB) in College Park, MD. </P>
		    <P>
		    The UMD 3.1 assembly is based on reads downloaded from 
		    the NCBI Trace Archive, most of which were sequenced by
		    the Baylor College of Medicine. UMD reports that they were
		    able to apply several assembly improvement techniques
		    to produce an assembly that is substantially more accurate 
		    and complete than alternative versions, as evaluated using
		    independent metrics. Based on UMD statistics, this 
		    assembly provides more genome coverage, closes 
		    thousands of gaps, corrects many erroneous inversions, 
		    deletions, and translocations, and fixes thousands of 
		    single-nucleotide errors. For more information, see 
		    Zimina AV <em>et al</em>,

              	    We'd like to thank the UMD CBCB for providing this genome 
		    assembly. The UMD Cow Genome Browser and annotation tracks 
		    were produced by Hiram Clawson, Chin Li, Brooke Rhead, Greg 
		    Roe, Steve Heitner, and Donna Karolchik.  See the
