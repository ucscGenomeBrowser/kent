<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This container is comprised of various DNA Methylation tracks from different sources.
Click on the specific subtracks for detailed descriptions of the data.</p>
<p>
The two tracks available are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Human Methylation Atlas Summary (hg38/hg19)</b> - Contains cell-type-specific marker regions
  identified from the atlas, including uniquely unmethylated loci and putative enhancer
  regions annotated with regulatory features.</li>
  <li><b>Human Methylation Atlas Signals (hg38/hg19)</b> - Contains per-cell-type methylation signal
  tracks (bigWig format) showing methylation beta values (0-1 scale) across the genome,
  with merged tracks for each cell type and individual sample replicates.</li>
</ul>
