<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays translated alignments of 728 million bases of <I>Tetraodon nigrovirisi</I> 
whole genome shotgun reads vs. the draft $organism genome. Areas painted by
this track are quite likely to be coding regions.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with BLAT in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The human
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running BLAT. </P>

<P>Many thanks to <A

providing the <I>Tetraodon</I> sequence.</P>
