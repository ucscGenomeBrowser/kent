<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This container track contains annotation tracks with variant frequencies, aka
allele frequencies, from these projects:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Mexico Biobank (MXB)</b>: This track displays allele frequencies from the Mexico Biobank (MXB), based on genotyping of 6,011 individuals sampled across all 32 states of Mexico during the 2000 National Health Survey (ENSA 2000) conducted by the National Institute of Public Health (INSP).
</ul>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>

<p>
The track sorts the haplotypes. This can be useful for determining the
similarity between the samples and inferring inheritance at a particular locus.
For a full description of how the display works, please see our 
<a href="../goldenpath/help/hgVcfTrackHelp.html">Haplotype Display Help Page</a>.
Briefly, each sample's phased and/or homozygous genotypes are split into haplotypes,
clustered by similarity around a central variant (in pink), and sorted for
display by their position in the clustering tree. Click a variant to center on it.
The tree (as space allows) is drawn in the label area next to the track image.
Leaf clusters, in which all haplotypes are identical (at least for the variants
used in clustering), are colored purple. 
</p>

<p>When zoomed it, it display alleles with base-specific coloring. Homozygote
data are shown as one letter, while heterozygotes will be displayed with both
letters.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>MXB: Allele frequencies by geographical state and ancestry are available via
the <a target=_blank href="https://morenolab.shinyapps.io/mexvar/">MexVar platform</a>.
Raw genotype data are available under controlled access at the
EGA (Study: EGAS00001005797; Dataset: EGAD00010002361).
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MXB: Genotyping was performed with the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Global Array
(MEGA, ~1.8M SNPs), optimized for admixed populations and enriched for
ancestry-informative and medically relevant variants. Only autosomal, biallelic
SNPs passing quality control are included. Samples were selected from 898
recruitment sites, with prioritization of Indigenous language speakers. Data
processing included GenomeStudio → PLINK conversion, strand alignment, removal
of duplicates, update of map positions using dbSNP Build 151 and low-quality
variants/individuals, and relatedness filtering.

<p>
We thank the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of Mexico for
generating and providing the frequency data, the National Institute of Medical
Sciences and Nutrition (INCMNSZ) for DNA extraction, and the Ministry of Health
together with the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) for the design and
implementation of the National Health Survey 2000 (ENSA 2000). We also thank
the ENSA-Genomics Consortium for their contributions to sample collection and
data processing that made possible the construction of the MXB genomic
resource.
