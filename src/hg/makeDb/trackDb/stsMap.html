<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows locations of Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers
along the draft assembly.  These markers have been mapped using 
either genetic mapping (Genethon, Marshfield, and deCODE maps),
radiation hybridization mapping (Stanford, Whitehead RH, and GeneMap99 maps) 
or YAC mapping (the Whitehead YAC map) techniques.</P>  
<P>
Genetic map markers are shown in blue; radiation hybrid map markers are shown 
in black. When a marker maps to multiple positions in the genome, it is 
displayed in a lighter color.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the color or 
include/exclude the display of a dataset from an individual lab. This is 
helpful when many items are shown in the track display, especially when only 
some are relevant to the current task. The filter is located at the top of 
the track description page, which is accessed via the small button to the 
left of the track's graphical display or through the link on the track's 
control menu.  To use the filter:
<OL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the map whose data you would like to 
highlight or exclude in the display. By default, the &quot;All Genetic&quot; 
option is selected.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight 
or include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the 
browser will not display data from the map selected in the pulldown list. 
If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser will display data only from 
the selected map.
</OL></P>
<P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> 
button.</P>
