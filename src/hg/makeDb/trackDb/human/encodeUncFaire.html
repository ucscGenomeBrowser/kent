<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) is a procedure 
used to isolate chromatin that is resistant to the formation of protein-DNA 
cross-links.  These tracks display FAIRE data from 2091 fibroblast cells 
hybridized to high-resolution <A HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/"
TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen</A> arrays that tile the ENCODE regions. The four 
datasets, in practical terms, can be thought of as independent replicates. 
However, because they were part of a series of experiments aimed at optimizing 
cross-linking conditions in human cells, the data represent different 
cross-linking times (1, 2, 4, and 7 minutes). Although the individual 
replicates are not displayed, the replicate data and also the signal averages 
and the peaks for the averages can be

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The FAIRE data are represented by three subtracks. One subtrack shows the 
average normalized log<sub>2</sub> ratios for the tiled probes; the other two 
subtracks 
display peaks.  The peaks in one set were determined using <em>PeakFinder</em> 
software supplied by NimbleGen.  A false positive rate (FPR) was estimated for 
the peak 
set using a permutation-based method. All peaks had an FPR of &lt; 0.01. The
peaks in the other set (Apr. 2006 update) were identified by ChIPOTle, a 
peak-finding algorithm that uses a sliding window to identify statistically
significant signals that comprise a peak.  A null distribution was determined 
by reflecting the negative data, which is presumed to be noise, about zero and 
a Gaussian distribution was fitted to it.  Windows were considered 
significant with a p-value &lt; 1e-25, after using the Benjamini-Hochberg 
correction for multiple tests.</P>

This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
one subtrack, uncheck the box next to the track you wish to hide. 
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the

configuration help</A> link. Note that the graphical configurations are only
available for the Signal subtrack, the Peaks subtracks are fixed. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
To perform FAIRE, proteins were cross-linked to DNA using 
1% formaldehyde solution, the complex was sheared using sonication, and a 
phenol/chloroform extraction was performed to remove DNA fragments 
crosslinked to protein.  The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase was 
fluorescently-labeled and hybridized to a microarray along with 
fluorescently-labeled genomic DNA as a control.  Ratios were scaled by 
subtracting the Tukey Bi-weight mean for the log-ratio values from each 
log-ratio value, as recomended by NimbleGen.  Results in yeast were 
consistent with enrichment for nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome. 
Therefore, the method may have utility as a positive selection for genomic 
regions with properties normally detected by assays like DNAse 
hypersensitivity. </P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The data were verified using PCR with primers designed to promoters enriched 
with FAIRE and downstream coding regions. </P>
