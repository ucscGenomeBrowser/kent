<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track provides an integrated display of DNase hypersensitivity in multiple cell types
using overlapping colored graphs of signal density. with graph colors assigned to cell types based
on similarity of signal.
The track is based on results of 
experiments performed by the John Stamatoyannapoulos lab at the University of Washington 
from September 2007 to January 2011 as part of the
<a href="../ENCODE" target="_blank">ENCODE project first production phase</a>.
The signal graphs displayed here are also included in the comprehensive
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase">DnaseI HS</a> track,
which also provides peak and region calls.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Raw sequence data files were processed by the UCSC ENCODE DNase analysis pipeline
described in the 
<A target="_blank" href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase">DNaseI HS</a>
track description.
Signal graphs were normalized so the average value genome-wide is 1.
Colors for the signal graphs were assigned by the UCSC BigWigCluster tool.
