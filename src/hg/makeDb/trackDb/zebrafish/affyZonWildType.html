<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows expression data from the <A HREF="http://zon.tchlab.org/" 
TARGET=_blank">Zon Lab</A> at Children's Hospital Boston using the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/zebrafish.affx"
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Zebrafish GeneChip Genome Array</A>. The chip type or 
strain medians associated with replicate experiments (Chip ID display) or 
the average of this data across all strains for each developmental stage 
(Tissue Averages display) can be displayed by selecting the appropriate 
option from the Experiment Display menu on the track description page. For 
more information, see the Track Configuration section.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For detailed information about the experimental methods, see Weber 
<em>et al.</em> (2005) below. This expression data is for five strains of wild 
type zebrafish whole embryos at different developmental stages. Alignments 
displayed on the track correspond to the target sequences used by Affymetrix 
to choose probes.</P>
<P>
Microarray data were preprocessed using MAS background correction, MAS
probe specific correction, and Loess normalization. 
<A HREF "http://bioconductor.org/download" TARGET=_blank">
Bioconductor's affy</A>
package was used to perform this processing. CEL files were normalized as
a single group and log2 transformed with scaling so that the average (mean) 
value of the expression data is zero for each single experiment.
The track color denotes the average (median) signal over all replicate 
experiments for a specific developmental stage and strain on a log base 2 
scale. Lighter colors correspond to lower signals; darker colors 
correspond to higher signals. 
Each row on the track or details page shows gene expression data for a 
single developmental stage and a single strain (see Strains and Stages table 
below) from wild type, whole embryo zebrafish. Data was collected by the 
<A HREF="http://zfrhmaps.tch.harvard.edu/ZonRHmapper/" 
TARGET=_blank>Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston Zebrafish Genome Initiative</A>. 
</P>
<P>
The rows show the median expression of a gene for a specific developmental 
stage and strain. Over-expressed genes are colored red; under-expressed genes
are show in green.
The values are colored on a logarithmic scale. Black indicates that a gene 
is neither over- nor under-expressed in the tissue. Uncolored boxes 
(white on most browsers) represent missing data. </P>
