<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a polymorphic locus that contains alleles
which differentially affect the expression of a continuously distributed 
phenotypic trait. Usually a QTL is a marker described by statistical 
association to quantitative variation in the particular phenotypic trait that
is thought to be controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple 
loci.</P>
