<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>For detailed information about the experiments, see Su et al.,

TARGET=_blank>"Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes."</A>, 
<I>PNAS</I>, Mar 19, 2002. Alignments displayed on the track
correspond to the target sequences used by Affymetrix from which to
choose probes.</P> 
<P>In dense mode, the track color denotes the average signal over all
experiments on a log base 2 scale. Lighter colors correspond to lower signals 
and darker colors correspond to higher signals. In full
mode, the color of each item represents the log base 2 ratio of the signal of
that particular experiment to the median signal of all experiments for that probe.
<P>More information about individual probes and probe sets is available at
Affymetrix's <A HREF="https://www.netaffx.com/index2.jsp"
