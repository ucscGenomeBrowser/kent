<!-- trackDb documentation Library
  In order to reference trackDb type and setting descriptions in multiple documents, this library
  file is designed to hold the one definitive copy of the setting or type description.

  *** Go ahead and try your changes by following existing examples.  
      If you have questions, read the detailed explanation below.

  *** Your changes can be seen in hgwdev or your sandbox when they are in:
      /usr/local/apache/htdocs-{sandbox}/goldenPath/help/trackDb/
      A "make" should get them there.

  ALWAYS VIEW trackDbTestBlurbs.html AFTER MODIFYING THIS FILE !!!!!!!

  How to add/maintain this documentation:
  There are 2 essential parts to trackDb*.html DOCS: I) this LIBRARY and II) the HTML PAGES.

  I) This LIBRARY consists of DIVs that contain "blurbs" describing settings and types.
     Example:
        <DIV class="someSetting"><span class="types bed bigBed"></span>
        <div class="format"><code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code></div>
            <P>Both <code>bed</code> and <code>bigBed</code> type tracks
            use <code>someSetting</code> in combination with
            <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A> to accomplish something.</P>
            <P><B>Example:</B></P>
            <pre>   someSetting 100</pre>
        </DIV>
  - Each "blurb" DIV should have the class={setting}.  There MUST be only one uniquely classed
    DIV for each setting or type.  NOTE: use class NOT id so that anchor links work.
    - Each "setting blurb" must contain a <span class="types..."> that lists the track types that
      this setting is relevant to.
    - Each setting blurb MUST contain a <div class="format"> that gives the exact format of the
      setting, wrapped in <code> tags.
    - The setting blurb should also contain an <B>Example:</B> followed by a preferably real life
      example wrapped in <PRE> tags.  Remeber multi-line <PRE> text will include the indents
      found in this file!
    - Some settings may refer to other settings and your blurb should include a link to the other
      setting, especially if that setting's blurb will appear at some distance in the document.
      Since all settings should have an anchor by the setting name, a "jumpTo" link to
      visibility setting can be accomplished as:
          <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A>
      which is identical to
          <A HREF="#visibility">visibility</A>
    - Any setting or code that is not made into a <A> link should be wrapped with <code> tags.
  - "Type setting blurbs" are the same as other setting blurbs except that there should be a
     seperate "example blurb" DIV with class of type_example (e.g. <DIV class="bed_example">).
    This will allow a type definition to be followed by multiple type specific settings then
    be completed by the example that references those settings.
    - These example blurbs should also have a "class=format" DIV but in this case it contains a
      title to the example:  <div class="format"><B>Examples of item base types</B></div>.
    - Exmples should make use of <PRE> tags and preferrably multiple real life examples.
  - Document introductions and section introductions may also be shared by multiple documents
    and therefore may be included here as "intro blurb" DIVs as: <DIV class="bed_intro">.
    - intro DIVs do not contain a class="format" DIV.
  - Use trackDbTestBurbs.html to test blurbs you add or modify.  It runs javascript tests.
  HINT: It is the class={setting} that ties things togther.  If there is a need for multiple
  descriptions of the same setting, then create multiple blurb DIVs with different classes as:
    <DIV class="parent"> and <DIV class="parent_view">.

  II) Document HTML PAGES should include this trackDbLibrary.html with server side includes
  and wrapped in <DIV ID="library"> tags.
  - Documents may differ, but using trackDbDoc.html as the example, the setting
    documentation is organized into tables by trackDb "type", so that settings are documented in
    the context of their use.  The (usually) single cell rows contain the settings.
    The settings specification includes a <DIV> with a class attribute of value "format", and the 
    setting name embedded in <CODE> tags.  In the trackDbHub document, the <CODE> tag has
    a class whose value defines the support level for the setting, as 'class="level-*"', where '*'
    is one of the levels defined in the introduction of the trackDbHub document.
    Note: New settings should always be added to the current (highest version) trackDbHub document
    in this directory (e.g. trackDbHub.v2.html) and designated "level-new".
    Settings table row example for trackDbDoc.html:
        <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD class="someSetting"><A name="someSetting"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
            <div class="format"><code>someSetting</code></div>
        </TD></TR>
    Settings table row example for trackDbHub.v?.html:
        <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD class="someSetting"><A name="someSetting"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
            <div class="format"><code class="level-new">someSetting</code></div>
        </TD></TR>
    - Any setting may be referenced multiple times.  To reference a setting blurb, place it in
      a table cell that contains class={setting} and a <IMG class='toggle detail'> tag.
      When the user clicks on the [+] button toggle image, the library will be read to render
      the <DIV class="{setting}">.
    - The table cell should also contain the "format" DIV, so the user knows what they are
      requesting.  The format contained in the doc will be replaced by the one in the
      library at toggle, so the library has the final word on format.  In the example,
      <code>someSetting</code> is replaced by <code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code>.
    - The first (or best) reference to your library blurb should contain the one and only
      "named anchor" for that setting <A name="{setting}">.  This named anchor MUST be at
      the beginning of the cell, before the toggle image. NOTE: the named anchor for a type is
      often put at the start of the table that describes it.
    - Related settings can be grouped as a set of related rows by adding the "related" class
      to the TR.  The first such related row must have class="related1st" as:
          <TR class="related1st" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="directUrl"> ...
          <TR class="related" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="hgsid">
      Related rows toggle as a set and have faint dividers between them.  The final setting DIV
      of a related set should have an example for the whole set.
  - Each table of settings for a particular type or set of types should end in an example. The
    Example cell behaves similarly to the setting cells, except the row has a special class:
        <TR class="examples" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="bed_example">
            <A name="bed_Examples"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
  - Each table should be headed with an introduction as:
        <THEAD><TR><TD><DIV ID="bed_intro" class="intro"></DIV></TD></TR></THEAD>
    All DIVs of class "intro" will be read from the library (by ID) and rendered when the
    page is first loaded.
  - Each table of settings can begin with a "toggle oneSection" image as:
      <TR VALIGN=TOP><TH><IMG class='toggle oneSection'> bed/bigBed - Item or region track settings
    This toggle will toggle all cells in the table.
  - The document as a whole should contain a "toggle all" image as:
        <IMG class='toggle all' />&nbsp;<I>Open/close all details.</I>
    which will open and close all the table cells.
  - The document should include a "self-assembling table of contents".  This table will be
    built if
    - There is an empty table of ID="toc": <TABLE class="settingsTable" id="toc"></TABLE>
    - The $(document).ready() event calls: tdbDoc.tocAssemble(<delay>,[<exclude>]);
      - delay (ms) greater than zero will delay the start of the assembly for user responsiveness
      - <exclude> can be a comma separated list of settings (class={setting}) to exclude
    - The table will fill in a header and a row per settingsTable td that contains a "format" div.
      The table will include 3 columns: setting, types that call it (from the "types" span) and
      the ID of the table that includes the setting.  Use this ID to be descriptive:
      ID="Signal_Track_Settings".
  Additional text, table of contents, etc. may best be built into the document, not the library.
  Please make use of "named anchors" and "jumpTo" anchors.  Add uniquely named anchors and directly
  reference those anchors as needed.

</DIV>

<DIV class="shortLabel"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>shortLabel</code></div>
    <P class="isRequired">Required: <span class="red">Yes</span></P>
    <P>Specifies the track's "short label", which is used in a
    number of places in the Browser to identify the track.  For
    example, the short label is displayed alongside the track in the Browser image.
    This label must be brief and is limited to 17 printable characters.
    Some <a href="../../../FAQ/FAQcustom.html#custom13">special characters</a>
    are allowed in the shortLabel.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B>

</DIV>

<DIV class="longLabel"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>longLabel</code></div>
    <P class="isRequired">Required: <span class="red">Yes</span></P>
    <P>Specifies the track's "long label", which is also used in
    numerous places in the Browser to identify a track.  For instance,
    the long label is displayed above the track's data in the Browser image.
    This label should be descriptive enough to
    allow users to uniquely identify the track within the Browser.  It
    is limited to 76 printable characters.
    Some <a href="../../../FAQ/FAQcustom.html#custom13">special characters</a>
    are allowed in the longLabel.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   longLabel Human mRNAs from GenBank</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="meta"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>meta</code></div>
    <P class="isRequired">Required: No</P>
    <P> Meta specifies the metadata tag for this track. This tag is a key into the metadata 
    table specified in either metaDb or metaTab in the genomes.txt file. The meta tag can be 
    any alphanumeric string. Each meta tag should appear in a trackDb stanza AND in either the 
    tab-separated file specified by metaTab, or tagStorm file specified by metaDb in the 
    hub's genomes.txt file. Examples on how to include metadata in your hubs can be found
    on the following <a href="/goldenPath/help/metadata.html">metadata guide</a>.
</DIV>

<DIV class="visibility"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>visibility</code></div>
    <P class="isRequired">Required: No</P>
    <P>Visibility (i.e. "display mode") specifies which of 5 modes (including 'hide')
    should be used to display the track within the Browser image.  This setting is
    almost always dynamically customizable by each user.  The exact configuration of the
    display for each mode depends upon the track's type, and some modes may not be supported
    for certain track types. Please note visibility settings in composite subtracks are
    directly inherited from the parent. Therefore, any visibility lines added at the subtrack
    level of a composite will be ignored. Be sure to experiment with this setting to
    verify that it works as expected for your track type and track structure.</P>
    <P>Valid settings:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI><code>hide</code>: DEFAULT. The track is not displayed in the Browser image unless
    the user changes the display setting.</LI>
    <LI><code>dense</code>: The track is displayed as a single line or
    ribbon.  In many cases multiple items are summarized or drawn on top of
    one another, and the long labels are not displayed.</LI>
    <LI><code>squish</code>: Each item is drawn individually, but at half height
    and without a label.  <i>(Not supported for all types.)</i></LI>
    <LI><code>pack</code>: Items are displayed individually at full height, but
    in a much more compact vertical space than in full mode.
    <i>(Not supported for all types.)</i></LI>
    <LI><code>full</code>: Each item is displayed as a separate line in the
    Browser image.  Graphed signals may be displayed in varying heights.</LI>
    </UL>
    <P><B>Example:</B>
    </P>
    <pre>   visibility dense</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="html"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>html</code></div>
    <P class="isRequired">Required: No</P>
    <p>Use the <code>html path/to/explain.html</code> to specify the file
    that contains the complete description of a track in HTML format.
    The path of this file name is relative to the path of the trackDb file, or it
    can be a full URL. It is also possible to have the &quot;.html&quot; suffix implied,
    for instance just have <code>html explainFile</code>. To further simplify trackDb,
    if there is a file, <code>nameOfTrack.html</code>, in the same directory as the
    trackDb matching the name of the track, <code>track nameOfTrack</code>,
    then the html file does not need to be declared.
    <p>To help users understand Public Hub data, we request you provide
    a web page that explains what your Track Hub is presenting.
    Adding an html page for your Track Hub is also useful to instruct people 
    on how to cite your data.</p>
    <p>To be consistent with standard Genome Browser track descriptions, html for tracks
    should contain several sections as seen below. Here is a link to an 
    <a href="../examples/hubExamples/templatePage.html" 
    target="_blank">example template</a> that you can use.</p>
    <div class="indent1">

    <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">bigDataIndex</A> is used.
    All occurrences of the  string <code>$D</code> in the URL will be
    substituted with the genome assembly database name.  This allows a
    trackDb entry to be used with for multiple assemblies.  <code>$D</code>
    substitution is not implemented for track hubs.

    <P>Configuration controls can be placed inside a
    box on the configuration page.  This setting is decorative only,
    but can make a busy page look more cohesive.  Not all
    track types currently support this feature, but the most common types do, including
    wig, bigWig, bed, and bigBed. DEFAULT: off.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>

    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.  Deprecated.</I></P>
    <P>Most tracks can be displayed in all five
    visibilities modes.  However on some track types such as
    wiggles, the <code>squish</code> and <code>pack</code> modes offer no real advantage
    over the <code>dense</code> and <code>full</code> modes. By default, these tracks will
    not offer the <code>squish</code> and <code>pack</code> vilibility settings.
    Nevertheless, you can make your track offer
    these visibility choices by turning canPack on.  Note: subtracks
    of composites will always offer all five choices.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   canPack on</pre>

<DIV class="color"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>color &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow the color of the data displayed in the image to be specified with 
    this setting.  The setting accepts
    red, green and blue values, each in the range of 0-255 and delimited by commas.  
    Though this setting is widely supported, some track types in certain display modes
    ignore it, such as the EST tracks in dense mode.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   color 255,0,0</pre>
    <P>This example sets the color to red.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="altColor"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>altColor &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow setting a color range that varies from <code>color</code> to
    <code>altColor</code>.  For instance the CpG Island tracks use the <code>altColor</code>
    setting to display the weaker islands, while the stronger ones are rendered in
    <code>color</code>.  If <code>altColor</code> is not specified, the system will
    use a color halfway between that specified in the <code>color</code> tag
    and white instead. Tracks using <code>altColor</code> with the windowing function
    &quot;mean+whiskers&quot; will see the shading of colors impacted, with lighter
    shades for values within a standard deviation around the mean, most noticeable when zoomed out
    and average calculations are taking place.</p>
</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   altColor 0,0,255</pre>
    <P>This example sets the alternate color to blue.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="chromosomes"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>chromosomes &lt;chr1,chr2,...&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Some datasets do not contain data for all
    chromosomes of a genome.  When this is true, use this setting as a
    comma-separated list of the chromosomes that are covered. The system
    displays a message that no data is available when the user browses
    chromosomes not included in this list.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   chromosomes chr1,chr7,chr18,chr19,chr22,chrX,chrM</pre>

<DIV class="configureByPopup"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>configureByPopup &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.</I></P>
    <P>Most track displays that can be configured by a user can also be
    configured from directly within the
    Browser image through a right-click option that pops up
    a configuration dialog.  While this functionality works on the
    majority of track types, some configuration dialogs are too
    complex or have too much embedded javascript control to be reliably
    configured through a pop-up.  To turn off the ability to configure the track
    via right-click, change this setting to "off".  The user will still be able to
    configure the track on the track's configuration page. DEFAULT: on.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   configureByPopup off</pre>

<DIV class="darkerLabels"><span class="types all"></span>
    <div class="format">
        <code>darkerLabels on</code><BR>
    </div>
        
    <P>If this setting is "on", the color of the left labels on the track display will 
    have a somewhat darker color than the track display itself.  This can be useful
    where the track color (which may have been chosen to adhere to external conventions) is too
    light for readable labels.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="dataVersion"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>dataVersion &lt;str&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many tracks undergo multiple revisions over time.  In some cases,
    the older versions should be retained, but even if they are not, it can be
    useful to declare the current version of the track.  Use
    this setting to display a version statement on the track
    configuration page and item details page of a track.  The string
    will support limited HTML. For native tracks, not track hubs, 
    this setting can also be a local absolute filename to read the version 
    string from.</P>

<div class="format"><code>iframeOptions &lt;string&gt;</code></div>
    <P>When <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">iframeUrl</A> is used, this

    practical or expedient. Therefore, the dataset may have its genome
    coordinates "lifted over" to the more recent assembly.

<DIV class="priority"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>priority &lt;float&gt;</code></div>
    <P>The priority is used to define the order of a track within its track group or

    The order within the image can be dynamically changed by the user and
    will always depend upon which other tracks are currently visible.
    Typically the priority is set only for tracks that are on by default in order to move them 
    ahead of other tracks. 
    Prioritized tracks within a group or data hub are displayed in ascending priority order, 
    followed by unprioritized tracks sorted alphabetically by short label. Tracks of the same 
    priority within a group or hub are sorted by short label.  
    Priority is a floating point number. Default: 0.</P>

    <P>The track setting of most tracks is the same as

    reference the same table in more than one track.
    An example of this is showing a table as a single signal track and
    as part of a combination overlay track, as described later in this
    document.  For data contained in MariaDB tables, this setting must be used
    if the <code>track</code> setting is not the name of the table.</P>

    <P>The Table Browser (and <a href=../api.html target=_blank>REST API</a>)
    typically allow querying and downloading of
    some or all of the raw data for a track. The <code>off</code> value blocks
    all API getData operations and Table Browser access to datasets with
    restrictions
    (for example, those with confidentiality or licensing limitations).  
    The <code>tbNoGenome</code> value allows unrestricted API getData
    operations, while limiting the table browser queries within specific
    genomic regions, but not genome-wide.
    The <code>noGenome</code> value prohibits API getData operations, while
    allowing table browser queries within specific genomic regions, but not
    genome-wide.  By naming additional tables in this setting, access to those 
    tables can be denied as well.</P>
    <P><B>Examples:</B></P>
    <pre>   tableBrowser off decipherRaw knownToDecipher</pre>

        Note that the format of this trackDb setting is a normal C
    language format so that the item will replace the "%s"
    token in the sql statement.</P>
    <!-- DONNA - I don't quite understand the idInUrlSql usage 
    TIM responds: By default the ID is the bed column 'name'.  That is what the $$ token
    gets replaced with in the url provided.  The idInUrlSql allows having a separate table
    in the mysql database that holds an alternate id.  No doubt this setting was for a 
    special case added by one engineer for one specific result.  Nevertheless, it is now one 
    of our many settings I needed to document.  So if a wrangler has a case where the 
    'name' in their bed table can be used to look up a different name in a different table,

    <P>This is similar to the <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">url</A> tag, but allows urls on fields
    that are not the "name" field. Use this statement if you need multiple
    linkouts on the details page or if your linkout is not
    based on the name field. </P>
    <P>
    Put the identifiers for these links into extended
    bigBed fields as explained in example 3 of the <a href="/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html#Ex3">bigBed documentation</a>.
    The field names from your .as file are the field names referenced in this statement.
    The urls in this statement support the same wildcards as the <A
    onclick="jumpTo(this)" href="#url">url</a> statement.  Make sure to enclose
    the URLs in double quotes.  The default label for the identifier is the field
    description in the .as file (all text after the # mark). 
    </P> 
    <p>The field can contain multiple values, separated by a comma "," where multiple links
    will then be created on each item. For instance, a &quot;pmid&quot; field with an
    entry &quot;11932250,34718705&quot; would create two links.</p>
    <p>
    If an entry of comma-separated values contains a &quot;|&quot; symbol, the part before the
    pipe symbol is used to replace the $$ wildcard and the part after it is used as the label,
    as opposed to the default label description in the .as file. This pipe substitution
    is similar to how Wikipedia markup encodes links. In the example below, a value for the
    field pmid of &quot;11932250|W James Kent&quot; would create a link with the URL
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11932250 and the label &quot;W James Kent&quot;.</p>

<H3>bigChain: Genome-wide Pairwise Alignments</H3>

    The bigChain format describes a pairwise alignment that allow gaps in both sequences simultaneously, just as Chain files do, but bigChain files are compressed and indexed as bigBeds. bigChain files are created using the program bedToBigBed with a special AutoSQL file that defines the fields of the bigChain. The resulting bigChain files are in an indexed binary format. The main advantage of the bigChain files is that only portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to UCSC. So for large data sets, bigChain is considerably faster than regular Chain files. The bigChain file remains on your web accessible server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server. Only the portion that is needed for the chromosomal position you are currently viewing is locally cached as a "sparse file".

    <P>Sometimes the

    this association, the feature must have the same name in each genome, and the name 
    must be unique within the bed track of each genome.  The components of this
    setting are a genome assembly database, an optional table and column,  
    with a label for the link.  If the column parameter is omitted, it is
    assumed to be <code>name</code>. If the table is omitted, it
    is assumed to be the same as the current table.  Links to multiple

<div class="decorator"><span class="types bed bigBed genePred bigGenePred psl bigPsl"></span>

    <p>Decorators allow annotation to be placed on top of BED 12+, bigBed, PSL, and
    bigGenePred tracks by highlighting regions and adding glyphs on top of them.
    The decorators themselves can be configured with a small selection of trackDb
    settings as follows.  For a more interactive introduction to decorators, see the <a
    href="../decorator.html">Track Decorators</a> help page.</p>
    <p>NB: In all of the following settings, <code>decorator.default.</code> is used as
    a prefix to indicate that the settings should be applied to the decorator and not the
    primary track.  This is necessary because many settings that you can apply to
    decorators are identical to settings that can be applied to tracks.  For example,
    <code>filterValues</code> can be applied to a main track to filter which items
    are displayed, but can also be applied to a decorator for that track as
    <code>decorator.default.filterValues</code> to filter which decorations are drawn.
    In the future, other names besides "default" may be allowed to permit multiple
    decorators annotating a single track.</p>

    <p>This setting is required when adding a decorator to a track.  It specifies
    the path to a bigBed file that contains the decorations.</p>
    <p><code>decorator.default.filterValues &lt;specification&gt;</code></p>
    <p>Decorators support the same filter options that bigBed tracks do.  This includes
    the <code>filter</code>, <code>filterText</code>, and <code>filterValues</code>
    settings, as described in the
    <a href="../hubQuickStartFilter.html">Track Hub Filters Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>
    <p><code>decorator.default.mouseOver &lt;specification&gt;</code></p>
    <p>Decorators also support the same <code>mouseOver</code> and <code>mouseOverField</code>
    settings that can be applied to bigBed tracks.</p>
    <p>There is one more setting that is currently specific to decorators.</p>
    <p><code>decorator.default.maxLabelBases &lt;integer&gt;</code></p>
    <p>This setting controls a failsafe option for deactivating the drawing of decoration
    labels when they're in block mode.  There will also be a checkbox on the track
    configuration page to deactivate labels manually, but even when that is on, a track
    display can quickly become unintelligible if the window displayed is too large -
    there will simply be too many track items and too many decoration labels to process
    visually.  <code>maxLabelBases</code> sets a maximum window size (in bases) for which
    labels will be drawn.  If not set, the value will default to 200kb.

<DIV class="labelOnFeature"><span class="types bed bigBed"></span>
<div class="format"><code>labelOnFeature &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Usually, labels (the BED name field) are drawn next to the
    features. This statement tries to draw the feature 
    label over the exon blocks. The effect depends on the size of the feature
    on the screen, which in turn depends on the zoom level. If there is not enough
    space for 4 characters, no label is drawn at all. If there is more space,
    the label is drawn with a contrasting color onto the exon-like blocks. 
    If they are too short for the text, it is trimmed to fit into the available space
    and the suffix "..." appended. Note that features should not have too
    long thin (UTR) regions, as the text might be hard to read
    in these parts.<br>
    To keep the text readable, the arrows that indicate the strand are shown over
    introns, but suppressed on blocks, so the statement should be used
    for tracks where strand is not of primary importance, not defined in the
    BED strand field or deactivated
    with <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">exonArrows</A>.  </P>

</DIV>

<DIV class="exonArrows"><span class="types genePred bed broadPeak"></span>
<div class="format"><code>exonArrows &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P>On tracks that show
    exons or blocks within features, exon arrows allow the user to jump to
    the next exon or block outside the image. Exon arrows are typically shown by default
    in these types of tracks, with the exception of tracks in the Regulation group. 
    The arrows can be explicitly shown or hidden using this setting.

<div class="format"><code>exonNumbers &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P>A mouseover that shows the exon and intron numbers 
    can be explicitly shown or hidden using this setting.
    The default is "on" for the track types genePred and bigGenePred.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>

    </div>
    <P>A number of
    numerical filters are available for bed tracks.  These are
    conveniently named by the field that is filtered on.  The most
    common numerical filter is based on the standard bed field
    <code>score</code>, and is thus controlled by the <code>scoreFilter</code>
    setting.  Other examples are pValueFilter, qValueFilter and
    signalFilter, which are filters on non-standard bed fields defined
    in the broadPeak and narrowPeak formats.  These numerical filter
    settings should include the default value.  If the numeric field
    is floating point, the default should contain at least one decimal
    place.
    </P>
    <P>By default the range
    of values for a numeric filter is 0 to 1000.  However, you
    can explicitly set the upper and lower limits of the filter by
    setting <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterLimits</code>.
    </P>
    <P>The numeric filters
    will exclude items that fall below the setting. That is, a
    scoreFilter of 800 will  exclude all items with a score below 800.
    You can also filter for values within a range, by including the
    <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterByRange</code> setting.  For example, a 
    <code>scoreFilter</code> range of
    800-900 will include only items with scores at or above 800 and
    below 900.</P>
    <P>Note: multiple
    filters of different fields are allowed.</P>
    <P><B>Examples:</B></P>
    <pre>   scoreFilter 100</pre>
    <P>In this example, the standard bed
    field <code>score</code>, which is an integer, will be used to filter items
    in the track.  By default, items with scores below 100 will be
    excluded.  Also by default the limits of the scoreFilter are
    0-1000.</P>
    <pre>
    pValueFilter 3.0:15.0
    pValueFilterLimits 0.0:15.0
    pValueFilterByRange on    </pre>
    <P>The non-standard bed field <code>pValue</code>, which
    is floating-point, will be filtered by range.  The expected data
    range is 0.0 to 15.0, and by default only items with pValues within the 3.0 to 15.0
    range will be displayed.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="scoreFilter"><span class="types bigBed"></span>

    <code>scoreFilter &lt;low&gt;[:&lt;high&gt;]</code><BR>
    <code>scoreFilterLimits &lt;low&gt;[:&lt;high&gt;]</code><BR>
    </div>
    <P>Type <code>bigBed</code> tracks can be filtered on the standard bed field
    <code>score</code>.  This numerical filter is requested by the 
    <code>scoreFilter</code> setting, which should include the default value.  
    </P>
    <P>By default the range
    of values for a score filter is from 0 to 1000.  However, you
    can explicitly set the upper and lower limit of the filter by
    setting <code>scoreFilterLimits</code>.
    </P>
    <P>The score filter will exclude items that fall below the setting. That is, a
    scoreFilter of 800 will exclude all items with a score below 800.</P>
    <p>Since the introduction of scoreFilter more powerful filter.&lt;fieldName&gt;
    options exist where the score column can be filtered with different syntax.
    In such a way <code>scoreFilter 400</code> and <code>scoreFilterLimits 0:1000</code>
    can be replaced with <code>filter.score 400</code> and <code>filterByRange.score 0:1000</code>.
    The advantage of switching to the filter.&lt;fieldName&gt; approach is that filters
    can also be added on additional bigBed &lt;fieldNames&gt; such as filterText.disease
    or filterValues.cellType where bigBeds defined with a disease or cellType column can
    be filtered. See filter.&lt;fieldName&gt; for more information and examples. </p>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    scoreFilter 300
    scoreFilterLimits 200:1000</pre>
    <P>The standard bed
    field of <code>score</code>, which is an integer will be used to filter items
    in the track.  By default, items with scores below 300 will be
    excluded.  The filter cannot be set to less than 200 or more than 1000..</P>

    <P>Another method of

    of discrete values that can be filtered on. These discrete values will be
    displayed in a dropdown list from which the user can choose one or

    not limited, displaying too many options can be confusing for the user.

    <P><I>Setting complexities:</I></P>
    <UL>
    <LI> Because filters for different fields are delimited by whitespace, any
    whitespace in titles and labels should be replaced by the '<code>_</code>'
    (underscore) character.</LI>
    <LI> Each field/option pair is joined by '<code>=</code>' (equal sign).</LI>
    <LI> The field portion
    can have a title that is delimited from the field name by '<code>:</code> (colon)'.</LI>
    <LI> A single field
    filter will have multiple options delimited by commas.</LI>
    <LI> If the options are
    a 1-based index (1,2,3...) then the option list can be preceded
    with a '<code>+</code>' (plus sign) and the options themselves are only labels.</LI>
    <LI> Otherwise, each
    option will be a value and optional label delimited by '<code>|</code>' (vertical bar).
    Note that if one option has a label then all options of that filter
    must have a label.</LI>
    <LI><em>Finally,
    options may have CSS style wrapped in {curly} brackets and
    appended to the end.</em></LI>
    </UL>
    <P><I>Because of this
    complexity, please remember to use the '<code>\</code>' continuation line to
    ensure the setting is readable:  </I>

             option2a[|label2a[{style2a}]],,...]    </pre>
    <P><I>It is probable
    that this setting will be redefined at some point, given that it
    is very complicated. However, this current format will
    be supported until entirely replaced.</I></P><BR>
    <div class="hintBox">
        <I class="red">Secret tricks:</I>
        <OL>
        <LI>Avoid the use of the delimiter chars <code> ,|:={}</code> in titles and
        labels.  (These characters can be included via HTML codes.)  
        Spaces can be included by using the '<code>_</code>' character.</LI>
        <LI>The option labels
        can be in color or have other CSS style attributes. Append the style 
        enclosed in curly brackets and containing no spaces. For example:
        <code>Pull_Over{color:#AA0000;text-decoration:blink;}</code>.
        If one option has CSS style, then all options of that
        filter must include a style definition.</LI>
        <LI>The filterBy option is implemented in the code using an SQL <code>where</code> clause.
        For instance, filtering on the <code>name</code> field for "Fred" and
        "Ethyl" would result in an SQL where clause of
        "<code>where name in ('Fred','Ethyl')</code>".  In <code>type genePred</code>
        tracks, this knowledge is used to define filters on fields in a separate table!
        This is done by defining the field as <code>{otherTableName}.{fieldName}</code>.</LI>
        </OL>
    </div>
    <P>The best way to
    understand this setting is with an example.  This is an operational
    example in the hg19 "Open Chrom Synth" track.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    filterBy color:Validation_Level=\
             0|Validated_(OC_1){color:#000000},\
             255|Open_Chromatin_(OC_2-3){color:#0000FF},\
             39168|DNase_low_(OC_2){color:#009900},\
             10027008|FAIRE_low_(OC_3){color:#990000},\
             16711935|ChIP-seq_(OC_4){color:#FF00FF} \
             ocCode:OC_Code=+\
             One&amp;#58;_Validated_(all),\
             Two&amp;#58;_DNase_(all),\
             Three&amp;#58;_FAIRE_(all),\
             Four&amp;#58;_ChIP_(all)    </pre>
    <P>This setting sets up
    two filters, one on the field "<code>color</code>" and a second for the
    "<code>ocCode</code>" field.  The color filter is given the title "Validation
    Level".  The second option has a value of "255" and a label
    of "Open Chromatin (OC 2-3)".  Note that it will appear
    as blue in the list due to the {color:#0000FF} style definition.
    Also notice that all options for this color field have a style
    defined, even though the first option is black and would be so by
    default. In this example, the only
    whitespace within the setting value section immediately precedes the second filter
    definition.  The second filter, "<code>ocCode</code>", is titled by the
    inscrutable "OC Code".  It is a numeric index filter
    (as declared by the '<code>+</code>').  The value of the second option is 2 and
    only the label gets defined as "Two: Dnase (all)".  Note
    that the colon in the label is an HTML code.
    </P>
    <P>The filterBy setting is very powerful. We recommend that you experiment with the
    settings to determine which work best for your case.</P>

    <pre>
    filter.score 300</pre>
    <P>In this second example, we are enabling filtering on the same field <code>score</code>, 
    however, we are passing the integer 300. This means that when the data is loaded, items with

    <pre>
    filter.signal 300:400
    filterByRange.signal on
    filterLimits.signal 200:500</pre>
    <P>In this example, we are enabling numerical filtering on the field <code>signal</code>. 
    <code>filterByRange.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> is also being enabled, allowing for filtering 
    between interval values, this also allows us to pass a range of values to the 
    <code>filter.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> parameter. In this case, by default only values between
    300 and 400 are being displayed. Lastly, the filter limits are being modified to accept values

    details.</P>
    <P><code>filterText.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> will enable two kinds of searching, wildcard and
    regexp. By default, the wildcard option is enabled. This means that a search term with 
    a wildcard (*) item on either end will match any number of additional characters before
    and/or after the search term. The regexp option allows for searching with <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#POSIX_basic_and_extended">regular

    a regexp search <code>.*BRCA.*</code>. The filter term can be freely changed in the track 
    setting page allowing users to filter on other values in the <code>geneName</code> field.</P>
    <pre>
    filterText.geneName *</pre>
    <P>This example is enabling filtering on the same field as above, <code>geneName</code>,
    however, it is not declaring a default search parameter. This is done by passing only an
    asterisk/wildcard (*). This means that the search box 
    will be present but no <code>geneName</code> items will be filtered out of the data 
    unless the user specifies a value.</P>
    <pre>
    filterText.geneName \.1$
    filterType.geneName regexp</pre>
    <P>
    This example once again enables filtering on the same field, however, it is declaring
    regexp as the filter type and passing a regular expression to be applied by default. 
    In this case, we are targeting all <code>geneName</code> items that are version 1.</P>

    </div>
    <P>There are a number of different filters available for bigBed data. See the     
    <a href="../hubQuickStartFilter.html" target="_blank">Filters Quick Start guide</a> for
    more info. Note: for configurable features, like filters, an additional period
    &quot;.&quot; or plus &quot;+&quot; is required in the type declaration,
    for instance <code>type bigBed 5 .</code> or <code>type bigBed 9 +</code>.</p>
    <P><code>filterValues.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> is used to enable filtering by 
    specified values within a field. It can be used on fields that can contain
    one text value or a list of comma-separated values of text, like "classA,classB".
    Usually these are category names.
    The option requires at least one value to filter on.</P>
    <P>Every individual possible value that can ever occur in the field must be
    passed in a comma separated list. If there are commas in the values, two commas
    can be used to designate literal commas. You will then be able to select those
    values as categories, choosing to display only items that
    belong to one, any, or at least one of the selected values. By default, the user
    can select multiple values from this list and the filter lets pass any features
    with at least one of these values (<code>multiple</code>).</P>
    <P>In order to choose the default selection behavior, the optional parameter
    <code>filterType.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> may be used. If this parameter is not passed,
    by default the selection will be set to &quot;one or more match&quot; which is the same
    as having <code>filterType.fieldName multiple</code>. If the user should
    only be able to select a single value, 
    <code>single</code> can be passed instead. Another option,
    <code>multipleListAnd</code>, means that the user can select multiple categories,
    but the filter will let pass only features where all of these categories are present.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both <code>single</code> and <code>multiple</code> have &quot;list&quot; options. These options
    split the bigBed field values by commas, meaning that they should only be used when items can
    contain multiple values at once in the desired filter field. For example, if my data is 
    classifying variants, and they can only be a SNV, insertion, or deletion, I will want to
    use <code>single</code> and <code>multiple</code>. However, if instead the filter will be
    on a field classifying functional impact, there can be many values for each item. For 
    example, variant rs11541299, which is both a synonymous variant and a 
    coding sequence variant. In this case, I would want to use one of the &quot;list&quot;
    options. Most simply <code>singleList</code> or <code>multipleList</code>, or one of
    the additional varieties of <code>multipleList</code> depending on the desired options.
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>multipleListOr</code> and <code>multipleListAnd</code> both still let the user
    override the type of combination manually in the user interface with a radio button. 
    If you specify <code>multipleListOnlyOr</code> or <code>multipleListOnlyAnd</code>
    then the radiobutton is suppressed and the user cannot choose between the options
    anymore. This can be used in cases where by the nature of the field, it
    makes little sense to offer the OR or AND search. 
    </P>
    <P>You can also choose which values to have selected by default using the
    <code>filterValuesDefault.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> parameter. It can take a comma separated
    list just like <code>filterValues.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code>, and any items included will be
    automatically selected. Not that the values need to be present in both settings.</P>  
    <P>The labels in the menu shown to the user can be configured to display a different name/label
    than the one present in the bigBed field. This can be helpful when the data values are
    written in short form, but you want a longer more descriptive name to show up in the UI.
    The format for this substitution is as follows:</P>
    <pre>filterValues.fieldName fieldValue1|alternativeName1,fieldValue2|alternativeName2...</pre>
    <P>E.g. if the value in the bigBed field is <code>AML</code>, a setting 
    like <code>Acute Myeloid Leukemia|AML</code> will show <code>Acute Myeloid Leukemia</code> 
    in the user interface but will lead to the value <code>AML</code> being searched in the bigBed 
    field. This can reduce the size of the bigBed file a lot. See example below for more information.</P>
    <P><B>Notes:</B><ul>
    <li>Currently, all values must be stated individually</li>
    <li>Value names must match exactly</li>
    <li>By default, all bed tracks that are at least bed5 will have a score filter. Enabling any 
    of the <code>filter*.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code> filter settings will disable that default 
    filter</li>
    <li>In order for filters to work, the track must be &quot;<code>type bigBed N +</code>&quot; or
    &quot;<code>type bigBed N .</code>&quot;. Including the &quot;+&quot; (for bigBed+ tracks) or a
    &quot;.&quot; (for non-extended bigBed tracks) is required
    <li>Filters are not supported in bed3 or bed4 files, even bed 3+x. The file must be
    at least a bed5</li>
    <li>There should not be any white spaces between declared items after commas, e.x.
    "itemOne,itemTwo,itemThree"</li>
    <li>The default label can be customized with the <a 
    href="#filterLabel"><code>filterLabel.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code></a> parameter</li>
    <li>When using filter values in a field that incudes commas, an additional comma
    can be used to escape it. E.x. "fieldOne,fieldTwo,,fieldTwo,fieldThree"</li>
    </ul></P>
    <P><B>Examples:</B></P>
    <pre>
    filterValues.OddEven Odd,Even</pre>
    <P>In this simple example, we are applying <code>filterValues.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code>
    to the <code>OddEven</code> field, which designates either &quot;Even&quot; 
    or &quot;Odd&quot;. We can then filter the data using the <code>OddEven</code> 
    field with a drop-down menu displayed on the track controls page to just evens or odds. 
    As there is no filterType, the user can also show both evens and odds at the same time.</P>
    <pre>
    filterValues.OddEven Odd,Even
    filterType.OddEven singleList</pre>
    <P>In this follow up example, we are passing the <code>filterType.fieldName singleList</code>
    parameter, which means that only one item in the <code>OddEven</code> field can be 
    chosen, in this case &quot;Odd&quot; or &quot;Even&quot;. This removes the default that 
    allows multiple selections.</P>
    <pre>
    filterValues.OddEven Odd,Even
    filterType.OddEven singleList
    filterValuesDefault.OddEven Odd</pre>
    <P>In this third example, we have added the <code>filterValuesDefault.fieldName</code>
    parameter as well. Now the default filter when the hub is loaded will have the Odd value
    preselected.</P>
    <pre>
    filterValues.annotationType DNA-BR,AS,BS,BSi</pre>
    <P>In this example the filter is being applied to multiple values in the 
    <code>annotationType</code> field. We can then select from these values in the 
    <code>annotationType</code> field with a drop-down menu displayed on the track settings page, 
    and display only items that match our selections. The selection choices will let us match
    one, all, or any combination of the supplied values.</P>
    <pre>
    filterValues.annotationType DNA-BR|DNA-binding region,AS|active site,BS|beta strand,BSi|binding site</pre>
    <P>In this follow up to the previous question, we have changed the name of the items that
    show up in the drop down menu to be more descriptive than the dense file format values. This means
    that if we wanted to only see items with <code>annotationType</code> of 
    <code>DNA-BR</code>, we would select <code>DNA-binding region</code> from the interface menu.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="filterLabel"><span class="types bed bigBed"></span>

    <P>When a user clicks on a track item in the Browser image,	
    the item detail page is shown. This setting specifies an
    alternate label for the filter on that page. Without this
    setting, the label will be the description of the field as 
    specified by the autoSql (.as) file. Some of the parameters modified by
    this are:</P>
    <P><ul><li><code>filter.&lt;fieldName&gt;</code></li>

    <pre>
    filterValues.strand +,-
    filterLabel.strand Strand (Orientation)</pre>
    <P>In this example, we have a standard &quot;strand&quot; BED field with the default

    <p>All of these settings follow exactly the same syntax and functionality as the filter.fieldName, filterByRange.fieldName, and filterLimits.fieldName explained above, except instead of items being excluded from the display, they are striped with a colored background to appear &quot;highlighted&quot; compared to the other items in the display. You can control the default highlight color with the highlightColor setting, or with the color picker on the configuration page when interacting with the track.

    <P><B>Examples:</B></P>
    <pre>
    highlight.blockCount 4</pre>
    <p>
    In this example, highlighting is enabled for the <code>blockCount</code> field. We are passing
    a default value of 4, which will highlight items where the blockCount is 4 or above.</p>
    <pre>
    highlight.score 300</pre>

    highlight.score 300:400
    highlightByRange.score on

    <p>
    In this example, we are enabling highlights for a range on the <code>score</code> field. The
    <code>highlightByRange</code> setting is also enabled, allowing for highlighting between

    <pre>
    highlightText.name \.1$
    highlightType.name regexp</pre>

    removed the default setting that allows multiple selections.</p>
    <pre>
    highlighValuesDefault.OddEven Odd</pre>
    <p>
    In this third example, we are using the <code>highlightValuesDefault.<fieldname></code> setting
    to set a default value for the highlight setting. Now the default will be to highlight items
    with an Odd value when the hub is loaded on the Genome Browser.</p>
    <pre>
    highlightValues.annotationType DNA-BR,AS,BS,BSi</pre>
    <p>
    In this fourth example, we are applying a highlight to multiple values in the

    <pre>
    highlightValues.annotationType DNA-BR|DNA-binding region,AS|active site,BS|beta strand,BSi|binding site</pre>
    <p>
    Similar to the last example, but we have changed the name of the items that show up in the
    drop-down menu to be more descriptive than the dense file format values. For example, if we

    <P>Note that the display of color is affected by the <code>maxItems</code> option.
    When the track is zoomed to the point that the number of items to display
    exceeds <code>maxItems</code>, the track is forced into dense mode and the items

    Default: 1000. For <code>type bigBed</code> tracks, this setting can never 
    be larger than the hg.conf setting bigBedMaxItems, which by default is 100,000 at UCSC.
    </P>
    <P>bigBedMaxItems is configured globally for a Genome Browser server and sets an upper limit
    on how many features can be loaded at most from a bigBed file, to avoid a
    single track making a Genome Browser view unusable at high zoom levels so
    it the upper limit for all maxItems settings of any tracks shown on a
    Genome Browser.  If you have feedback on these values,
    please do not hesitate to contact us.</P>

<div class="format"><code>maxWindowCoverage &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <p>When too many individual bed items might be shown in the Browser image
    (such as might occur when a large region of a chromosome is viewed),
    <code>maxWindowCoverage</code> will switch the track into density coverage plot when
    the window contains more than the specified number of bases.</p>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   maxWindowCoverage 10000000</pre>
    <p>Browser images that show more than 10,000,000 bases will result in the track data

<DIV class="maxWindowToDraw"><span class="types bed genepred bam rmsk narrowPeak broadPeak bigWig bedlogR"></span>
<div class="format"><code>maxWindowToDraw &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <p>When too many individual bed items might be shown in the Browser image
    (such as might occur when a large region of a chromosome is viewed),
    <code>maxWindowToDraw</code> will trigger a choice to display a message
    asking users to zoom in to a smaller region.</p>
    <p>Depending on the current visibility
    of the bed track and which other tracks are being shown concurrently, the
    Browser may automatically reduce the display to pack or dense mode in some cases.
    The <code>maxWindowToDraw</code> setting allows you to force users to zoom in
    as an overriding message will block out the data display. Unlike the <code>maxItems</code>
    setting, which controls the display of vertical space and forces a display to dense
    when the maximum number of items is exceeded, the <code>maxWindowToDraw</code>
    setting dictates the number of bases to be displayed in a window
    before the track is obscured with a message explaining the
    requirement for zooming-in. Even without this setting,
    there are browser operations that will ultimately prevent too many items from
    being displayed by forcing a visualized summary in dense mode as noted.</p>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   maxWindowToDraw 10000000</pre>
    <p>Browser images that show more than 10,000,000 bases will result in the track data

    does not show the first word of the BED item name,
    but uses this first word for linking out to the item detail page. This
    allows putting both an identifier, like a gene ID, and its human-readable
    description into the BED item name field, separated by a space.
    </P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   linkIdInName on</pre>
    <P>
    A BED name field of "9005 PITX2" will be shown "PITX2" on the genome
    browser, but when the user clicks on it, the URL will be built only from
    the first word, by default cgi-bin/hgc?i=9005&amp;(...). The URL can be
    changed with <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">directUrl</A>, where %s
    is replaced by the identifier.
    </P>
    <p>
    bigBed files are often created using the UCSC <tt>bedToBigBed</tt> program.
    By default, this program expects only a single word for BED item names.  To
    tell the program to accept multiple words separated by spaces (required for
    this track setting), you will need to use the <tt>-tab</tt> option for
    <tt>bedToBigBed</tt>.  This tells the program that that tab characters are
    used instead of spaces to separate fields of the BED file.  Please note that
    this option will only work if tab characters are used as the field separator
    throughout your BED file.  More information on creating bigBed files is
    available <a href="../bigBed.html">here</a>.

    the MariaDB database in a form that can be graphed.  By default the
    value to be graphed is the fifth standard bed field,
    <code>score</code>;  however, you can specify a different field to use.
    Typically only the first 3 standard bed fields are included
    (<code>chrom</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>) and the fourth field
    contains the signal value.  The bedGraph track offers
    a couple of important improvements over the wig track.  In wig
    tracks, the value of the signal is truncated into a single byte,
    which is effective for graphing but fails at data storage.  Also
    the wig type was originally designed for fixed-size windowing, though
    variations were added.  The bedGraph type allows for variable
    windowing and defining values even down to the base level.  To be
    clear, bigWig tracks are as versatile as bedGraphs.  It is
    only the wig format that suffers from these limitations.</P>

    <P>On the other hand the storage density of wig, particularly the fixed step
    variant, is vastly denser than bedGraph. In cases where the data is solely
    meant for display, the 256 levels supported by wig more than suffice.  For
    single-base or even 10-base level resolutions, bedGraph is generally not practical
    genome-wide.  Note also that wigs converted to bigWigs do not suffer the reduced
    precision of wigs loaded directly into the database.   A bigWig based on fixedStep
    wigs is the best way to represent dense graphs over the genome.</P>

    <P>Note that the lower and upper limits of the bedGraph signal are not declared in the type, 
    but rather are declared with 2 separate settings, <code>minLimit</code> and
    <code>maxLimit</code>.

<DIV class="alwaysZero"><span class="types wig bedGraph bigWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>alwaysZero  &lt;off/on&gt;</code></div>
    <P>When autoScale is set to "on" or "group" in the signal track, 
    additionally setting <code>alwaysZero</code> to "on" will ensure that the y=0
    value will be in view at all times. Default: off.
    </P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="autoScale"><span class="types wig bigWig bedGraph hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>autoScale &lt;off/on/group&gt;</code></div>
    <P>This setting is available for both the graph types of tracks (wig,
    bigWig, bedGraph) and the Hi-C heatmap tracks (hic).  It behaves slightly
    differently for each.</p>
    <p>For graph tracks, the graph of the data displayed in the Browser image
    is usually scaled on the y-axis in absolute coordinates.  However, you can
    display the data in two types of autoScale which will ensure either that
    the high score in the current viewing window will peak at the top of the
    graph, or that all tracks in a composite will be scaled according to the
    highest point in the viewing window of any visible tracks in the same
    composite.  Like most graph settings, this is configurable by the user.
    Setting it to "<code>on</code>" in trackDb will default the track to
    <code>auto-scale to data view</code>. The setting will independently
    scale its y-axis based on the data within the track. Setting it to
    "<code>group</code>" in trackDb will default the track to
    <code>group auto-scale</code>. With this setting, tracks within the same
    group will share the same y-axis scaling. This means that the maximum and
    minimum values on the y-axis will be determined based on the data across
    all tracks within the same group. This can be useful when comparing
    multiple tracks and wanting to ensure consistency in scaling. The
    default is "<code>off</code>" which will set the track to
    <code>use vertical viewing range setting</code>.</P>
    <P>NOTE: These options can be misleading if a noisy, low signal
    erroneously appears as significant because there is no high signal in the
    view window. To use the <b>group</b> option declare the setting only in
    the parent bigWig composite, not in the individual children tracks.</P>
    <p>For Hi-C tracks, higher interaction scores are represented with more
    intense colors.  When this setting is set to "<code>off</code>", the score
    at which the color reaches maximum intensity is a fixed value that can
    be chosen with the <code>saturationScore</code> trackDb setting.  When this
    setting is set to "<code>on</code>", the maximum intensity score
    changes dynamically depending on the values in the current viewing window.
    The default value for this setting is "<code>on</code>".  The
    "<code>group</code>" option for autoScale is not available for Hi-C
    tracks.</p>

    more than 100 pixels and no less than 8, with a default of 16 or
    32 pixels.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   maxHeightPixels 100:16:8</pre>

    <P>When signal data is clicked in the Browser image, the details of the signal
    in the current viewing window are displayed.  For bigWigs that
    reference remote data, the query can be a very expensive operation if the current window 
    is large.  To avoid overburdening the Browser, the size of the window to

    Be aware that wiggles with negative values are drawn in <B>altColor</B> not <B>color</B> as
    positive values are. Also, tracks using the windowing function "mean+whiskers" will see the

    <P>Often signal
    information is chunky, because a single value is given for a number of
    bases.  The graph can smooth the chunky data, presenting a display
    more reflective of the actual biology it is meant to illustrate.
    The numerical value of this setting determines how much
    surrounding data to use for smoothing: the larger the number, the
    less abrupt the curves will be.  The setting is user-configurable. Default: off.</P>

    <P>The data of most interest in a graph
    track may be contained within a narrow range.  Typically 
    high outlier values can skew a graph and very low values may

<DIV class="windowingFunction"><span class="types wig bigWig bedGraph"></span>
<div class="format"><code>windowingFunction  &lt;mean/mean+whiskers/maximum/minimum&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Depending upon how large of a genomic region
    is displayed in the Browser image, it may be necessary to summarize
    the actual signal.  This user-configurable setting controls how the Browser 
    collapses the signal from (for example) 100 or 100 thousand bases down to
    a single pixel.  By default
    the single pixel represents the <code>mean</code> of the data, though the
    <code>maximum</code> or <code>minimum</code> can alternatively be displayed.  A more informative
    option is often <code>mean+whiskers</code>.  This setting displays the
    mean, max and one standard deviation above mean, differentiated by shading. 
    The mean is displayed as the darkest shade, one stdDev above mean as 
    slightly lighter, and the max as the lightest shade.
    This subtle shading can quickly indicate if the
    condensed data is hiding important information that can 
    be adequately evaluated only by zooming in.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   windowingFunction mean+whiskers</pre>
    <P>When zoomed out, this track will show the mean
    signal but include shading representing higher scores.  The user
    may change this setting.</P>

    <code>yLineOnOff &lt;off/on&gt;</code><BR>
    <code>gridDefault   on</code></div>
    <P>It can be useful to
    draw a line across the track's signal graph at some fixed y
    coordinate.  Do this by setting <code>yLineOnOff</code> to "on" and specifying the
    y coordinate with <code>yLineMark</code>.  These two settings are
    configurable by the user. Defaults: off and 0.0.</P>
    <P>Often confused with
    these configurable settings is the <code>gridDefault</code>, which simply draws a
    a line at y=0 across your entire track.  This setting might be
    useful if the lack of data is equivalent to a 0 signal.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    yLineOnOff on
    yLineMark 2.5
    gridDefault on    </pre>
    <P>The signal is graphed with a default solid line
    at zero, suggesting that any gaps in data should be interpreted as

<H3>bam/cram: Compressed Sequence Alignment/Map tracks</H3>
    <P>The bam/cram format is an
    indexed compressed data format for sequence alignments.  It is ideal
    for remote access of high-throughput sequence tags and is a native
    output format for some high-throughput sequencing (HTS) aligners.
    The format of bam data is data-file pairs, with an index in a separate file.
    CRAM files are compressed versions of BAM files where the reference sequence is not included.
    CRAM files should be listed as "type bam" in trackDb.
    These are frequently remote datasets, not residing on the UCSC server.  Please refer to
    the <A HREF="../bam.html">BAM track format page</A> or <A HREF="../cram.html">CRAM track format page</A> 
    and the <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/" TARGET=_blank>SAMtools website</A>

    <P>Possible settings:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI><code>strand</code>: (Default) When colored by strand, mismatched bases are highlighted in
    <B style="color:#FF0000;">bright red</B>, alignments on the reverse strand are
    colored <B style="color:#880000;">dark red</B>, and alignments on the forward strand are
    colored <B style="color:#000088;">dark blue</B>.</LI>
    <LI><code>gray</code>: When colored in grayscale, items are shaded according to the 
    method specified by <code>bamGrayMode</code>: alignment quality, base qualities, or unpaired
    ends.</LI>
    <LI><code>tag</code>: Colors are specified in "user-defined tags". SAM/BAM may
    include user-defined tags, the names of which begin with X, Y or Z and include one other letter
    or number. The user-defined tag named here specifies red, green and blue (RGB) intensities
    as a zero-terminated string (tag type Z) containing comma-separated triples of numbers
    from 0-255. For example, if a SAM/BAM record includes the tag YC:Z:255,0,0, then the
    item is colored red; YC:Z:0,0,255 makes the item blue. By default, the tag is "YC" unless
    changed using the <code>bamColorTag</code> setting.</LI>
<!-- DONNA - don't understand what he means by "tag named here". TIM answers: I welcome a rewrite 
    here.  In this section "tag" is being used in 2 ways. Sequence "tags" are the bam "items" 
    (akin to bed items).  But "bamColorMode tag" refers to special "tags imbedded in the bam 
    data file.  In both cases I was using the terminology of the art.  High-throughput 
    sequencing often refers to sequence tags as the short stretches of 20-100bp that are 
    aligned to the reference genome.  But the "YC" style codes imbedded in the bam file are 
    also referred to as tags by bam documentation.  Honestly I do not know much about these

    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.  Nor are any of the settings in this section.</I></P>
    <P>While "<code>chain</code>" and
    "<code>netAlign</code>" formats are different, they often are paired to show two
    different views of the same data.
    </P>
    <P>Chain tracks show
    alignments of a "query" species to a "target" genome assembly.  For
    example, a chimp panTro2 can be aligned to the human hg19 genome.
    The chain format allows for gaps in both sequences simultaneously.
    When chains are viewed in the Browser, they show solid boxes for
    alignments, separated by either single or double lines.  The single
    lines appear when an insertion occurs in the target or a deletion
    occurs in the querying species.  Double lines represent gaps in both
    species that could result from a number of causes (e.g. an inversion
    in one species).  For more information on the "chain" format, please
    refer to <A HREF="../chain.html">
    http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html</A>.</P>
    <P>A netAlign track
    represents the best chain for each region in the target genome.  The net
    track will show the largest, highest scoring chains that span a
    region.  When these chains have gaps, they may be filled in
    with additional chains, shown at a lower level, and gaps in these
    chains may in turn be filled at an even lower level.  These levels
    help in visualizing genome rearrangements such as inversions and
    retroposed elements.    For more information on the netAlign
    format, please refer to

    <P>Though
    many microarray experiments have been superseded by high-throughput
    sequencing (e.g., ChIP-seq) experiments, several microarray tracks
    still exist.  Further, microarray experiments can be the economical

    that should be turned into a standard HTML table on the details page for that item. If
    the &lt;fieldName&gt; starts with &quot;_json&quot; or &quot;json&quot;, then the system
    expects the data in &lt;fieldName&gt; to be valid JSON. If the field name starts with
    anything else, then the table is formatted using &quot;|&quot; and &quot;;&quot; as field
    and new row separators. The &quot;table title&quot; part of the statment is optional, if

    Genomes Project</A> for releases of single nucleotide
    variants, indels, copy number variants and structural variants

    projects. When a VCF file is compressed and indexed
    using <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml" TARGET="_blank">tabix</A>
    and then made web-accessible, the Browser will fetch only the portions of
    the file necessary to display items in the viewed region. In other

    The bigInteract format stores interactions between pairs of regions in the genome.
BigInteract files are created using the program bedToBigBed with a special 
AutoSQL file that defines the fields.  The resulting files are in an indexed binary format
that supports efficient remote access, so the file can be hosted on your web accessible server
and displayed at UCSC.

<DIV class="interactDirectional"><span class="types bigInteract"></span>
<div class="format"><code>interactDirectional &lt;true|offsetSource|offsetTarget|clusterSource|clusterTarget&gt;</code></div>
    <P>This setting is used when the interaction has an orientation (direction of effect). The offset setting shows the source (offsetSource) or target (offsetTarget) below the other end type; that is vertically displaced in the image.  The interaction is drawn with dashed lines when the target region precedes the source region (reverse direction) in the genome.
    </P>
    <P>The cluster setting collects all interactions with the same source (clusterSource) or target (clusterTarget) and displays each group as a single linked block display in the browser. This provides an alternate view of an interact file.

    <P>
    The hic track type is for displaying chromatin-chromatin interaction data via heat
maps.  Currently this track type supports one file format: the .hic file format created
by the <a href="https://www.aidenlab.org" target="_blank">Aiden Lab</a> at <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.bcm.edu">Baylor College of Medicine</a>.  This is an indexed
binary format that supports remote access, so the file can be hosted on any web accessible
server and displayed at UCSC.  More details on .hic display at UCSC can be found at the
<a href="../hic.html">hic help page</a>.
For more information on the .hic file format and the Juicer tool that generates these files,
see the documentation on <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Data">github</a>.</p>
</DIV>

<div class="drawMode"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>drawMode &lt;triangle|square|arc&gt;</code></div>
    <p>This setting controls the default display mode for the hic track. In arc
mode, an interaction between two regions is drawn as an arc between the centers
of those two regions.  In square mode, interactions are represented by a square
in a heatmap.  The interacting regions for any square can be identified by
projecting the sides of the square onto the diagonal axis of the heatmap and
seeing where those points fall in the chromosome window being viewed.  In
triangle mode, interactions are drawn as diamonds.  The interaction regions for
any diamond can be identified by projecting the sides of the diamond onto the
horizontal axis of the heatmap and seeing where those points fall in the
chromosome window.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="normalization"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>normalization &lt;NONE|VC|VC_SQRT|KR&gt;</code></div>
    <p>This setting controls which method is the default for normalizing the raw
scores from the .hic file.  Scores for all of these methods are computed during
the creation of the .hic file.  For more information on these methods, see the
Juicer documentation linked above.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="resolution"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>resolution &lt;Auto|integer&gt;</code></div>
    <p>This setting controls the default size of the bins that the Hi-C contact
results are grouped into.  The list of available resolutions depends on the
file, but common values include numbers like 5000 and 10000.  In addition to an
integer value, the string <code>Auto</code> can also be provided (Auto is also
the default if this setting is not specified).  In Auto mode, the browser will
dynamically choose a resolution that seems to provide a good amount of detail
depending on the size of the chromosome window currently being viewed.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="saturationScore"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>saturationScore &lt;float&gt;</code></div>
    <p>The saturationScore setting is part of how the color shades of the
heatmap are displayed.  Colors in the heatmap correlate with the score of each
interaction - a higher interaction score corresponds to a higher color
intensity.  At some point, however, maximum color saturation is reached and higher
interaction scores don't change the color any further.  This setting determines
what the default score is for the point at which that maximum color saturation is
reached.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="hicDistanceMin"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>hicDistanceMin &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <p>Hi-C tracks have a setting that controls the minimum interaction distance
in nucleotides for the heatmap.  If a portion of the heatmap represents an interaction
closer than the value of the minimum distance setting, that portion of the heatmap simply
isn't drawn.  This setting, hicDistanceMin, controls the default value for that
minimum (without this setting, the default is 0).  A value of 0 means that no filter
is applied.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="hicDistanceMax"><span class="types hic"></span>
<div class="format"><code>hicDistanceMax &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <p>Hi-C tracks have a setting that controls the maximum interaction distance
in nucleotides for the heatmap.  If a portion of the heatmap represents an interaction
farther than the value of the maximum distance setting, that portion of the heatmap simply
isn't drawn.  This setting, hicDistanceMax, controls the default value for that
maximum (without this setting, the default is 0).  A value of 0 means that no filter

<DIV class="superTrack_intro">
<H3>Supertrack settings</H3>
    <P>The first 
    hierarchical container is called the supertrack, which may be thought of as 
    a folder that holds other tracks that by default are closed, unless the
    setting <code>show</code> is added. The Browser currently supports only one
    level of supertrack folders.  Generally the subtracks
    of a supertrack are of differing types.  If all the children are
    of the same type, it is often better to use the <a href="#compositeTrack">compositeTrack</a> grouping
    described below.  If all of the children are wig or bigWig tracks, it may
    be of interest to use a signal overlay "container multiWig" grouping. Signal
    overlay tracks display the signal data from several subtracks as colored
    transparencies, making it possible to see the data of several tracks together
    in a condensed view. See the <A HREF="#aggregate">multiWig</A> section for more information.</P> 
    <P>Supertracks can contain
    composite tracks and container multiWigs, but not vice versa. With supertracks,
    composite tracks, and container multiWigs, children will inherit the settings
    from their parents, but can override their parent settings within their own stanzas.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="superTrack"><span class="types superTrack"></span>
<div class="format"><code>superTrack on show</code></div>
    <p>
    To declare a supertrack, simply add this
    setting to a track definition that will hold a few standard
    settings. To set a supertrack to display as default add the word show,
    <code>superTrack on show</code>, to the end of the statement. To have
    the supertrack not display by default use only <code>superTrack on</code>.
    It may help to think of the original declaring supertrack stanza as a
    light switch that by default is off, and can be flipped on by adding <code>show</code>.</p>
    <p>
    All tracks that claim membership to the supertrack should set their
    own visibilities in lower stanzas by declaring settings such as
    <code>parent superTrack1</code> and also by having a separate
    <code>visibility dense</code> line. If no visibility setting
    is defined for a track, the default setting of hide is assigned.
    This can cause confusion if one mistakenly tries to set visibilities only
    at the top supertack stanza, not allowed, and leaves them out for each child.</p>
    <p>
    Do not confuse the parent line with how it is used in composites. For example,
    in supertracks DO NOT follow the example of <strike><code>parent superTrack1 [off/on]</code></strike>,
    where <code>[off/on]</code> will only work with composite tracks. When attempting to debug visibility
    settings, it may be helpful to read the <A href='#inheritance'>note about
    inheritance</A> found below.</p>

<DIV class="parent_supertrack"><span class="types superTrack"></span>
<div class="format"><code>parent &lt;superTrack&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Membership in a supertrack, composite, or aggregate track is declared by the

    Do not confuse the parent line with how it is used in composites. For example,
    in supertracks DO NOT follow the example of <code>parent compositeTrack1 [off/on]</code>,
    which will only work with composite tracks.</p>
    <p>
    Any number of children may belong to one supertrack, but ten is a suggested number for usability
    considerations.  Stylistically, children's stanzas within the trackDB typically are indented
    directly under the stanza of the parent. However, this is less frequently the case with
    supertracks, because the children are often scattered in other places within the trackDb 
    file, or the supertrack children are themselves composites containing
    additional indentation that makes enforcement of the supertrack
    indentation impractical.</p>
    <p>
    All tracks that claim membership to the supertrack should set their
    own visibilities in lower stanzas by declaring separate settings such as
    <code>visibility dense</code>.When attempting to debug visibility settings, it may be

    <P>When you have many subtracks in a composite track, it may be useful on the
    Track Setting page, also known as the hgTrackUi configuration page, to rearrange
    the subtracks.  One avenue of rearranging many subtracks is to employ the
    <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">sortOrder</A> setting, as described below, 
    or by allowing the user to drag and drop the subtracks to a new order 
    on the Track Setting page. The <code>dragAndDrop subTracks</code> setting will enable
    dragging by clicking on the check mark next to the subtrack on the configuration page.
    Tracks can thereby be rearranged into a final desired order, that will then be seen when
    browsing the tracks. However, the order of tracks can also be rearranged on the hgTracks 
    Browser image by directly dragging and dropping the displayed track data. Yet reordering subtracks
    in the Browser image in hgTracks will not be reflected back on the hgTrackUi configuration page.

    This section describes the configuration of "subgroups"; "views" are discussed in
    a subsequent section.</P>
    <P>
    The subgroup can be used for selecting sets of subtracks for display based on certain
    characteristics of the data. For instance, if  "cell" and "antibody" are
    defined as subgroups within a composite track, the user will be able to select
    subtracks based on specific cell types and antibodies to display in the Browser.  Up to 9
    subgroup types can be defined for a composite.  However, to minimize the complexity,
    it is strongly recommended that only two subgroups be defined
    for a given composite track. These will be presented in a simple X/Y matrix that is easy for
    the user to understand and navigate. It is possible to define more subgroups in additional 
    "abc" dimensions that will be presented to the user as drop-down multi-select dialogs,
    but use of these should be avoided or minimized.</P>

    membership pairs joined by an '<code>=</code>' equals sign. </P>
    <ul>
    <li> <code>tag</code>: Used in the code to select
    and sort subtracks based upon their membership.  Tag names
    must be alphanumeric, begin with a letter, not contain a period, and be formed
    such that the desired sort order of the member subtracks will result.</li>
    <li> <code>title</code>: Label of the subgroup as it appears on the 
    selection matrix that is displayed to the user, e.g.,"Antibody". Spaces within
    titles must be replaced by '<code>_</code>'.  A limited amount
    of HTML is allowed in titles, such as the insertion  of Greek letters using an HTML
    code. Any use of HTML should be tested to ensure that it displays correctly.</li>

    <P>Because subgroup settings are often lengthy, it is recommended that the

<div class="format"><code>subGroups &lt;gTag1=mTag1?&gt; [gTag2= mTag2?]</code></div>
    <P>The subtracks themselves declare their
    membership in a group with the <code>subGroups</code> setting.
    Each subtrack must declare its membership in all of its
    composite's subgroups.  Notice that membership is declared
    by pairs of tags: the group tag (e.g. gTag1) is paired with that
    group's member tag (e.g. mTag1b) as gTag1=mTag1b (cell=K562).</P>

    <P>In order to define the type of UI desired for
    selecting subtracks based upon groups, additional settings are
    needed at the composite level.  For a one- or two-dimensional array of
    checkboxes, declare the dimensions X and Y.  Additional dimensions (called
    "abc") can be declared with this setting as dimA, dimB, etc.</P>  
    <P>Note that the order of the subgroups in a dimension is exactly the same as 
    the order they appear in the <code>subGroup#</code> setting, regardless of whether
    the subtrack list is sorted by tags. Please also note that if a hub is not going to use
    the X,Y matrix, dimX should be the first dimension defined rather than dimA.
    Also, the setting <code>allButtonPair on</code> will prevent the matrix from displaying.</p>

<DIV class="filterComposite"><span class="types subGroups"></span>
<div class="format"><code>filterComposite &lt;dim[A/B/C][=one]&gt; [dimB dimC ...]</code></div>
    <P>For the "abc"
    dimensions, rows of checkboxes will be shown by default.  However, this
    UI can be confusing, especially combined with a one- or two-dimensional matrix.
    Instead, it is recommended that you organize "abc"
    dimensions as drop-down multi-selects, often referred to as
    "filter" boxes due to their similarity to the
    <code>filterBy</code> setting discussed
    above.  Declare the subtrack filter boxes with the <code>filterComposite</code>
    setting.  Filter composites may work with or without the X/Y
    matrix, but are restricted to the "abc" dimensions.</P>
    <P>By default, the filter box for selecting
    subtracks is multi-select, meaning more than one choice is
    allowed.  It is possible to restrict this to a single choice by
    adding the "<code>=one</code>" option to the filter box definition.
    This might make sense when there are only 2 choices.  The choice
    of "all" is always available, while choosing nothing is an invalid
    case. Please note that if a hub is not going to use the X,Y matrix,
    then dimX should be the first dimension defined rather than dimA.</P>

    <P>One more complication in the selection process is
    determining which subgroup options are selected by default.  In the
    case of the X/Y matrix this can be determined by what subtracks
    are currently checked.  But, "abc" dimensions must have their
    selected state declared explicitly using the

    <P>In ENCODE, subgroups
    are often based on metadata terms declared in the metaDb table and defined
    in the "controlled vocabulary", which is 
    stored as an ra file.  In this situation, the labels of these
    terms, as they are displayed in the track configuration page, can
    be linked to the controlled vocabulary definitions.  These links
    can be quite useful, as the term definition may include protocol
    documents and validation evidence.  In order to establish the
    links, each subGroup's tag must be tied to the actual metaDb
    term.

<DIV class="sortOrder"><span class="types subGroups"></span>
<div class="format"><code>sortOrder &lt;gTag#=+/-&gt; [gTag#=- &hellip;]</code></div>
    <P>When declaring subgroups, it is often useful to
    sort the subtrack list by those subgroups.  By including a
    sortOrder setting, long sets of subtracks are more easily
    organized and navigated by the user.  If there are only a few
    subtracks in the composite, sorting may be of little value and 
    <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">dragAndDrop</a> may be a better option.
    Currently only subgroups can be defined in the sortOrder, but it
    is anticipated that this will expand to include short and long
    labels as well.  Sorting will occur on the tag values defined in the 
    <code>subGroup#</code> and <code>subGroups</code> settings.  By sorting
    on tags, non-alphanumeric orders can be defined.</P>

    <P>Some composite track sets have their own
    directories of downloadable files and a special CGI for accessing
    those files.  In order to see the CGI interface for the download
    directory, the composite needs an object for each file defined in
    the metaDb.  The trackDb stanza for the composite also needs to
    have the fileSortOrder setting defined.  The setting is defined as
    a set of variable=value pairs, which defines the default sort
    order on metaDb variables.  The "var" portion of the each pair is
    a term defined in the metaDb for all of the file objects in the
    directory.  The "var" may also be "<code>fileType</code>" or "<code>fileSize</code>",
    which are not defined in the metaDb. The "val" is the title that the
    user will see as the column header for the sortable table of
    files.  This value can contain and '<code>_</code>' for spaces and limited HTML
        codes and special characters.  As always, you are encouraged to
    experiment.  The '<code>\</code>' continuation character should be used to
    break up this long setting into readable lines.

    <P>In this second example composite,

    declared as the "A"
    dimension; the user will be able to select subtracks for this
    dimension via a dropdown multi-select filter box.  All three subgroups 
    participate in the default sort order of subtracks, and the treatment subgroup is 
    sorted in reverse order by default.  The "None" treatment
    sorts before all others (in reverse order) by beginning the tag with
    a "Z".  Note that for this "A" dimension,
    the "None" treatment will be selected by default.  By
    declaring the proper settings, using subGroups to organize a
    composite can be quite powerful.</P>

    <P>This example illustrates that
    subgroups, dimensions, and (in the case of ENCODE) controlled vocabulary and
    metadata all must be linked together for the composite to fully
    work.  Further, the actual terms, programmatic "tags"
    and user visible titles all have different constraints and roles
    to play in establishing this cohesion.  Subgroup tags are used to
    organize subtracks, while lettered dimensions organize the
    configuration page to more easily select subgroups of subtracks.
    For ENCODE tracks, the subgroups may be represented as metadata
    "terms" (distinct from tags) that are often carefully
    defined by a controlled vocabulary.  In the example above, the tag
    "ab" is used to organize subtracks into subgroups but
    is also tied to dimension X.  This ensures that antibodies will
    appear as the horizontal dimension in the 2D matrix on the
    configuration page, and the selection of an antibody will select the
    associated subtracks.  Of course the user does not see the
    antibody as "ab" but "Antibody".  Going
    further, the term as defined in controlled vocabulary is
    "antibody", so that for all the tables and files
    associated with this composite track, their metaDb objects should
    contain an "antibody" var and a given antibody (e.g.
    H3K4me3) will be found in the controlled vocabulary with a
    validation document.  All the relationships can be confusing, but
    the trackDb settings, if done correctly, can tie all these
    elements together in a nice cohesive package.</P>

<!-- - - - - - - - VIEW settings - - - - - - - -->
<DIV class="view_intro">
<H3>Views</H3>
    <P>In addition to subgroups, a single
    composite can be divided into multiple "views".  Recall
    that a composite should be made up of subtracks of the same <code>type</code>.
    However, different types of subtracks can be combined into the same
    composite track if they are in separate  "views".  While
    views are like subgroups in many ways, they can carry their own
    settings.  This is necessary because the views within a composite may be for different
    types that have their own distinct configuration settings, for example bigBeds and
    bigWigs. </P>
    <P>The "view" (or
    "multi-view") organization is typically used when the
    same basic data is stored in multiple formats and granularities.  For
    example, a collection of views may include short read sequence alignments (type bam), signals
    representing pile-ups of aligned reads (type bigWig), and the  peaks (type
    bigBed) that are called in regions where  the evidence of experimental result is
    deemed significant.  These three "views" of the same
    experimental data can be seen more informatively as a cohesive set
    within a multi-view composite track.</P>
    <P>Views are declared both
    as a subgroup and as a separate track stanza.  A composite with
    multiple views has only views as children, and each view will have one
    or more subtracks as children.  The three levels must be defined
    together with indenting to make the hierarchy obvious.</P>
    
    <P id='inheritance'><div class="hintBox"><I><U>A note about
    inheritance.</U></I> Subtracks
    will inherit settings from their parents (both from composites and
    from views).  This is true when the setting is inheritable, which is generally
    the case.  Obvious exceptions are settings that are
    relevant only to the higher level.  Inheritance follows the "closest
    to home" paradigm in which a setting at the subtrack level
    takes precedence, followed by the view level setting, and finally 
    the composite level setting.  This inheritance applies to both the trackDb default settings 
    and the choices made by a user. Settings made 
    by the user involve a timing element as well:  a change to 
    a parent-level setting will override all settings of
    the same type for its children.  If the user subsequently makes a subtrack
    setting, it will override the inherited setting for that one
    subtrack.<BR><BR>
    An anomaly within the inheritance scheme is the "<code>visibility</code>" (display mode) 
    setting.  Unlike other settings, visibility is cumulatively restrictive from the
    supertrack level.  That is, if the parent has a visibility of  "<code>dense</code>" and the 
    child's visibility is
    "<code>pack</code>", the child will be displayed as "<code>dense</code>". If the parent is
    subsequently changed to "<code>full</code>" display mode, the child will now be shown in 
    "<code>pack</code>" mode.  At the trackDb
    level, default visibility is always cumulatively restrictive.
    However, when a user explicitly changes a subtrack visibility to be
    greater than what was inherited from parents, that subtrack's
    visibility will override the inheritance.  While the subtleties of
    inheritance can be hard to explain, they are often intuitive in
    practice. In composite subtracks, visibility settings are directly
    inherited from the parent composite, therefore, any visibility lines
    added at the child subtrack level of a composite will be ignored.
    Also note the <a href="#parent">parent</a> line should be referenced as
    <code>parent myComposite on</code> if one desires the child subtrack
    in a composite to be visible (checked, selected) by default.</p></div></P>

    <P>A view is always declared both as a subgroup

    previous declarations, but the view subgroup must have the tag

    too cluttered.  The user must first open the box before its
    contents are seen.  If there is only one view with configuration
    settings, or if the view is the most important one, the box can be

<DIV class="configurable"><span class="types view composite"></span>

    <P>Tracks are configurable by default if their

    configurable if their children's track type supports this.
    Finally individual subtracks are configurable by default
    if their track type supports it.  Sometimes it is desirable
    to turn off configuration.  Configuration may be turned back
    on when it has been turned off at a higher level. For example, this might be
    useful in a situation with a multi-view composite where the composite
    level would normally be configurable, but you want only one of the
    views and not all of the children of that view to be configurable.
    While this setting might be rarely needed, it can help restrict
    the user from viewing your data in inappropriate ways.</P>

    <P>The composite has two views, one of which is
    shown, along with a single subtrack belonging to that view.
    Notice that the view does not participate in the dimensions
    setting, as it is an implicit dimension controlled by a row of
    visibility dialogs at the top of the composite configuration page.
    Notice that the view does participate in the sortOrder setting
    like other subgroups.  In this example, the peaks view contains
    bigBed subtracks that all share the scoreFilter defaults
    defined at the view level.  Almost any setting that is common to
    the whole tree can be defined at the composite level; any setting
    that is common to the view can be set at the view level; and any
    setting that is specific to one subtrack should be set at that
    level.  Remembering <A href='#inheritance'>inheritance</A>, we 
    can see that the subtrack shown inherits its track type from
    the view, but has its default visibility limited by the composite.
    That is, it inherits packed visibility from the view but the
    composite will show all visible subtracks as dense.</P>

    <P>One additional thing to note is that this composite track is
    "<code>type bed 3</code>".  Composites do not need a type to define 
    their data format, since all data is associated with subtracks. Further, 
    multi-view composites almost always have multiple data formats.  
    But the "type" also controls what configuration options may be offered 
    for a track.  Typically, a single level composite has the same type as 
    all of its subtracks and offers user configuration options at the top 
    level. But a multi-view composite is most often given the bare-bones 
    "<code>type bed 3</code>", and offers user configuration options at 
    the view level.  Exceptions to this pattern do exist but they are rare.</P>

<!-- - - - - - - - CONTAINER/MULTIWIG/AGGREGATE settings - - - - - - - -->
<DIV class="container_intro">
<H3>Aggregate or Overlay Tracks: multiWig</H3>
    <P>In some instances, data from multiple tracks is so closely
    related that it makes sense to view it as a single track.  The
    premiere example of this is the signal overlay
    track (i.e. "<code>multiWig</code>").  Signal overlay tracks display the signal
    data from several subtracks combined in several different ways, making it
    possible to see the data of several tracks together in a condensed
    view. The default overlay method for multiWigs is as colored transparencies,
    in which all the graphs are drawn on top of one other in such a way
    that overlapping regions are a different color. Another choice
    is solid overlay, where all the graphs are still drawn overlapping each
    other, but without transparency.  A third choice is stacked
    where the values of the subtracks are stacked on top of one another with
    no overlap such that the total height of the wiggle is the sum of 
    all the values in the subtracks.
    The value of the overlay track surpasses simply condensing the
    image.  Occasionally this is the most effective way to identify
    hidden relationships in the underlying data.  The overlay track
    should not be overused, however.  Attempts to overlay too many
    subtracks can hide important information as regions with many layered
    signals become too dark to interpret.  More than eight subtracks in a
    single overlay may prove less than ideal.  As with composites,
    it is important for the multiWig tracks to have the same data dimensions, 
    i.e. a signal height of 100 should be interpretable in the same
    way for the whole set of tracks.  While this is true for a composite
    or view, it is especially important for overlay tracks.  You cannot
    reasonably overlay a signal from 0-1 with another signal from 0-1000.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="container"><span class="types container multiWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>container multiWig</code></div>
    <P>Signal overlay tracks are declared much like
    simple composites.  However, instead of a "composite"
    setting, they declare themselves as a "container" of
    "<code>type multiWig</code>".  Like simple composites, all subtrack
    types should be identical and the container itself should be
    declared as the same type (e.g. "<code>bigWig</code>").  Also like a composite,
    the container parent should have common settings for all children.
    Unlike composites, containers can have neither subgroups nor
    views.  Additionally, all subtracks within a container are configured as one; 
    there is no independent configuration of individual subtracks.  Even when the user

    larger range than the others.  The signal dimensions are close
    enough in this case, and the default viewLimit applied to all

    strong. Note that each subtrack must define its color, and
    in this example, that color will be seen in the track
    configuration page as well as in the image.  Also notice that the
    first subtrack declares a table as distinct from its track name.
    Usually the table (or remote file root) name is the same as the
    track name.  The track name is a unique key.  But it is frequently
    the case that a table or remote data file may be displayed as an
    individual track or subtrack, as well  as part of a signal overlay
    track.  Setting the table name here suggests that a track named
