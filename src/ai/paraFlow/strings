The ParaFlow strings are carefully crafted.  The modern
programmer tends to spend at least as much time working with
strings as they do with numbers.  

I. String Constants
A simple string constant is enclosed in single or double quotes with
no line breaks.  Examples are 'Linus Pauling' and "Linus Pauling's Mother".
The traditional C escapes including \n, \t, \\, and \n are used.

String constants can also be line oriented.  In this case the quotation
is immediately followed by a line break.   Everything up until a line
that starts with the quotation mark is included.  Some examples are:

"
This is a poem
that wishes it were
a haiku.
"

'
If I keep getting spammed about ways to improve
my mental health, I swear I'm going to crack!
'

Sometimes you have a block of text you want to use as a string, and
even the line quotes won't work.  For those occasions use the 'quote to marker'
construct.  The marker can be any symbols not including white space.
The quotation includes everything between the marker and the next
occurence of the marker except for the first space right after the
marker.   For instance the string defined by
    quote to CUSTOMQUOTEMARKER Hello world!CUSTOMQUOTEMARKER
is the same as the string defined by "Hello world!".  Normally
you'd use the quote to marker construct on more complex text
such as:

quote to CUSTOMQUOTEMARKER "What are you doing?" I asked.

"I'm trying to write a program." responded Bill.  "It's full of
'if' and 'else' and 'while' and 'to' and lots of other words
that look normal enough, but really aren't."

"Ah, well good luck with that!" I said.CUSTOMQUOTEMARKER


II. String Operations.
The only operations allowed on strings are:
	=	Assignment
	+	Concatenation.  If used with a number converts the number to a string.
	==	Equality
	!=	Inequality
	< <= >= >	Alphabetical comparison (ascii)
You can also index an array to get a byte.  The indexes are zero based.

III. String Methods and Attributes.
These are applied by adding a dot after the string variable.

string.size	- The number of characters in string.

string.dupe() into string s	
    Produce a duplicate of this string.

string.start(int size) into string s
    Return a new string that contains just the first size letters of this string.
    For instance "Cat in the hat".start(3) = "Cat"

string.rest(int start) into string s
    Returns a new string that contains all but the first start number of letters.
    For instance "Cat in the hat".rest(3) = " in the hat"

string.middle(int start, int size) into string s
    Returns a new string that is the same as the size letters starting at start
    (which is zero based).  For instance "0123456789".middle(3,5) is "34567".

string.end(int size) into string s
    Returns a new string that contains the last size letters of this string.
    For instance "Catin the hat".end(3) = "hat"

string.upper()
    Converts this string to upper case.

string.lower()
    Coverts this string to lower case.

string.append(string s)
    Appends s to end of this string.  This tries to achieve a balance between
    memory usage and speed.  The first call will allocate additional memory
    for the string,  generally enough for several more operations.  When the
    size of the buffer holding the string is increased it is increased to twice
    what is needed for the current append until the buffer gets quite large.
    At that point it just allocates 64k more than needed for the current operation.

string.find(string s) into int pos
    Returns the position of the first occurence of s in string.  This position
    is zero based.  If s is not contained in string then it returns -1.

string.findNext(string s, int startingPos) into int pos
    Returns the next occurence of s in string that occurs at the starting pos
    or later.

string.nextSpaced(int pos) into (string word, int nextPos)
    Returns next white-space-delimited word starting at pos or later.
    The characters space, tab, and newline are considered white space.
    Does not return any of the white space.  Also returns nextPos,
    which should be used in the next call to nextWord.  The pos
    initially should be 0.

string.nextWord(int pos) into (string word, int nextPos)
    Returns next word deliminated by white space or punctuation.
    The punctuation is returned as a single character word.
    The character '_' is not considered punctuation, and can be
    included in a word.

floatString(double f, int digitsBeforeDecimal, int digitsAfterDecimal, 
            bit scientific) into string s
    This returns a floating point number formatted just how you like it.
    Here's some examples:
         floatString(12.3456, 3, 2, 0) = " 12.35"
	 floatString(12.3456, 0, 3, 0) = "12.346"
	 floatString(12.3456, 0, 3, 1) = "1.234e+01"

intString(long l, int minWidth, bit zeroPad, bit commas)
    This returns an integer or long number formatted various
    ways.  Here's some examples 
    	intString(1234, 0, 0, 0) = "1234"
	intString(1234, 6, 0, 0) = "  1234"
	intString(1234, 6, 1, 0) = "001234"
	intString(1234, 0, 0, 1) = "1,234"


IV. String Plans

Here are some plans for other methods:

string.splitSpaced(string s) into array of string words
    Create an array containing white-space separated words

string.splitWords(string s) into array of words separated
    by white space or punctuation.  Punctuation marks are
    considered single character words.

string.tokenize(string s) into array of string tokens
    Create an array containing an entry for each token
    according to some rules similar to what the paraFlow
    compiler uses.  White space is ignored. Quoted strings
    are returned as a single token.

string.splitWith(string s, string splitter) into array of string fields
    Separate string based on any of the characters in splitter.  These
    characters will not be included in the fields output.  If two of
    the splitter chars are next to each other it will create an empty
    string for that slot.
