##### ADDED IMAGEFILE-FORWARDING TO COMBINE MAHONEY AND JAX-MAHONEY ANNOTATIONS (DONE 2006-04-26 galt)
# The idea here is that JAX has some useful annotations, but including them made a lot of 
# unnecessary duplication in the system.  Although it wasn't easy, we have come up with
# a method to map the imageFiles from Mahoney to the ones in JAX.  We have made imageFileFwd table
# to store that mapping information, and added code to hgVisiGene to use it.  Wholemount steps
# are manual, while slices steps use hg/visiGene/vgLoadJax/forwardSlices.c I wrote to map them Mah->JAX.
# Additional complications are that JAX combined several slices together into one image
# following a certain pattern.  Luckily for the wholemounts, the original images were not modified by JAX.
# This means that we can get a perfect match Mah->JAX for the wholemounts using md5sum (produced unique values).
# Because both we and JAX imported the Mahoney data/spreadsheet into auto-incremented primary keyfield
# tables, the original order is preserved and allows a surprisingly good mah->jax many-to-one slices mapping.
# I also extended vgLoadJax to be able to find the primers in the PRB_Notes which was useful both 
# for mapping the slices, and because we end up using JAX annotations for the fullCaption() page,
# so that we don't lose primer info. For the remaining fraction where Mahoney never supplied primers
# (actually they have since updated the info, but neither JAX nor we have gotten that yet),
# something over 20%, we have managed to instead just map on gene. This worked surprisingly well,
# and made either correct or very close matches.

# Since previously, vgLoadJax looked for the mahoney set in jax and excluded it, we need to 
# make and import it into visiGene.  I have removed the skipping of mahoney set from the 
# vgLoadJax code (so that next time we update jax, the mahoney set will not be excluded)
# and added a commandline option to do just a single submission set.  I happen to know that
# the mahoney set in jax is jax92242.  THIS STEP WON'T BE NEEDED IN FUTURE.

# the latest jax sybase db conversion is on kkr3u00 because it had space and little use.

###  JACKSON UPDATE (re-done to fix expression data 2006-06-05 galt)  #############

# The expression data was not correctly matching subpanels,
# and the bodyPart was incorrectly displaying just "floor plate" 
# instead of the full part-tree-lineage available in field printName.
#
# We found the solution in vgLoadJax was to NOT use the GXD_Expression
# table at all - apparently it is not necessary as the data is in other tables.
# This meant that we are using GXD_Strength values instead of the old 1/0 for level.
# We made the vgLoadJax code treat these correctly, and tweaked hgVisiGene too.
# And then we also decided to add the expression pattern while we were at it
# since JAX db had it - so added it to vgLoadJax and hgVisiGene.

# previously updated: jackson20060328 db on kkr3u00 
# (see above, and see hg/visiGene/jackson/makeJackson.doc)

# save imageFileFwd data in new form for easy restore:
create table iffKeepThis as
