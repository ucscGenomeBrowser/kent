<!-- HTML Summary of UW DNase Array (GM06990) -->
<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays DNaseI sensitivity/hypersensitivity mapped over 
ENCODE regions in lymphoblastoid cells (ENCODE common cell line GM06990) 
using the DNase-array methodology described in Sabo <em>et al.</em> (2006).
DNaseI hypersensitivity signifies chromatin accessibility following 
binding of trans-acting factors in place of a canonical nucleosome, 
and is a universal feature of active cis-regulatory sequences in vivo. 
Peaks in DNaseI sensitivity signal measured using DNase/Array represent 
DNaseI hypersensitive sites.


<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DNase-array comprises the following steps:  (1) treatment of nuclear 
chromatin with DNaseI; (2) isolation of short (avg. length ~450 bp) 
DNA segments released by two DNaseI “hits” occurring in close proximity 
on the same nuclear chromatin template; (3) differential labeling of 
fragments and a control (DNaseI-treated naked DNA); (4) hybridization 
to a tiling DNA microarray (Nimblegen ENCODE array), without amplification. 
Signal peaks correspond to DNaseI hypersensitive sites.


<H2>Validation</H2>
<P>
The data have been extensively validated by conventional DNaseI 
hypersensitivity assays (indirect end-label + Southern blotting 
method). The data have an overall sensitivity of 91.7%, and specificity 
of >99.5% for DNaseI hypersensitive sites.   Note that the tiling array 
covers only non-repetitive regions.
