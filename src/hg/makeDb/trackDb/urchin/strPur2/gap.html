<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.

Many of these gaps &mdash; with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps &mdash; may be closed during the
finishing process.

<P>

This track depicts gaps in the assembly. These gaps - with the exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the finishing process.

<P>

Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track. If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side of the gap is known, it is a bridged gap and a white line is drawn through the black box representing the gap.

<P>

This assembly contains fragment gaps, which are gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. (In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
