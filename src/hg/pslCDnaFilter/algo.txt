Filtering algorithm: 

  The filters are applied in the following order to each set of
alignments for a given cDNA sequence.

  o PSLs that are not internally consistent, such has having
    overlapping blocks, are dropped.  Use pslCheck program to
    get the details.

  o Drop if repMatch/totalMatch is greater than maxRepMatch.

  o Drop queries less than the min size.

  o Filter by minimum identity to the target sequence.

  o Filter by minimum coverage, if polyA sizes are supplied, the
    poly-A tail is not included in coverage calculation.

  o Keep only best overlapping alignment. This is the one with
    the highest score. However, don't dropping weird overlaps.
    Weird alignments are sets of alignments for a given query
    that overlap, however the same query bases align to
    different target bases.  These will be included in the
    output unless dropped by another filter criteria.  These are
    often caused by tandem repeats.  A small fraction of
    differently aligned bases are allowed to handle different
    block boundaries.

  o Filter by minSpan.

  o Filter by either global or local near best in genome.
    See notes below for handling of haplotype pseudochromsomes.

  o Filter by maxAligns

Filtering of haplotype regions:

  Haplotypes stored as pseudo-chromosomes require special
handling during comparative filtering to prevent alignments from
being dropped from one or more versions a haplotype region.  The
following algorithm is applied to filtering all of the
alignments of a given cDNA.  Association of hapolotype
alignments to reference alignments is not done until other
filtering has take place, which limits problem cases.

   o Alignments of hapolotype pseudo-chromosomes to hapolotype
     regions of reference chromosomes are supplied in PSL format
     (hapMappingAlns)

   o Foreach cDNA alignment to a haplotype pseudo-chromosomes
     (hapAln):
     o map hapAln to reference chromsome using hapMappingAlns,
       which can create multiple mappedHapAlns.
     o foreach refAln:
       o foreach mappedHapAlns:
         o transMap the mappedHapAln with refAln to make
           cDNA to cDNA alignment (hapRefCdnaAln)
         o Determine the number of bases in hapRefCdnaAln align
           that are either mapped to the same mRNA base.
           Bases of refAln that are outside of the haplotype region
           on the chromosome are are not counted.  This is divided
           by the total number of mRNA bases that could be counted
           (excludes outside of the hap region), to form a score.
       o link refAln and hapAln if any of the same bases aligned

   o Alignments that are not linked are treated as independent
     alignments by the comparitive filtering.

   o When a near-best comparative filter is applied, each
     refAln and it's linked set of hapAlns are treated as if it
     where a single alignment. The best score for the linked set
     is used.  If any of the refAlns that a hapAln is linked to
     is kept, it is kept, otherwise the hap align is dropped.
