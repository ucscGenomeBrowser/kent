				<P>
				Genes function and evolve together. To understand a gene,
				you often need to understand an entire gene family.
				Many such families are already known and described, such as the 
				HOX family that mediates many aspects of limb and brain development 
				and the Cytochrome P450 family that is central to the metabolism of many 
				medications.
				<P>
				One easy way to identify well-known relatives of a gene 
				is by looking for genes with name similarity, because biologists 
				tend to use similar names for similar genes. However, scientists
				only partly understand the function of perhaps one-third of
				the genes of the genome; therefore, other techniques for grouping genes
				into families are necessary.  
				<P>
				The UCSC Gene Family Browser is an excellent resource for 
				exploring gene families and the relationships among genes. This 
				tool displays a table of genes within 
				a selected genome that are related to one another. Several 
				different relationships may be explored: protein-level homology, 
				similarity of gene expression profiles, or genomic proximity. The 
				Browser supports searches on a variety of terms and phrases, 
				including the gene name, the SwissProt protein name, a GenBank 
				accession, or a word or phrase present in a gene's description. The 
				gene family display is highly configurable, allowing the user to 
				control the order and number of columns, the number of rows, and 
				the genes displayed. The tool provides several output formats, 
				including a simple tab-delimited format that may be imported into a 
				spreadsheet or a relational database.
				<P>
				An important use of the Browser is to gather 
				together a collection of genes that share similar properties for
				statistical analysis.  For instance, one might want to examine
				promoter regions of genes that share a similar expression
				pattern  or look for protein sequence motifs in genes that
				share similar GO annotations.  
				<P>
				One of the most powerful features of the Browser is its 
				filtering capabilities. The filter enables the user to 
				quickly select an interesting subset of the 25,000 genes in 
				the genome based on a variety of detailed and flexible selection criteria. 
				For example, the filter 
				may be used to select all human genes over-expressed in the cerebellum 
				that have GO-annotated G-protein coupled receptor activity. 
				<P>
				The Gene Family Browser was designed and implemented by Jim Kent, 
				Fan Hsu, David Haussler, and the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group. 
				This work is supported by a grant from the National Human Genome 
				Research Institute and by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

                                The main page of the Gene Family Browser displays a table
				containing rows of genes and associated attributes. In most 
				cases, the currently-selected gene is shown at the top of 
				the list, highlighted in light green. The remaining genes
				are ordered relative to the selected gene based on the sort
				criteria specified in the <em>sort by</em> menu. For example,
				in a table sorted by gene distance, the genes are listed in
				order of greater to lesser chromosomal proximity to the 
				selected gene.
				<P>				
				The initial Browser display shows only a default subset of
				the columns available. The set of columns may be expanded,
				reduced, and rearranged by using the Browser's 
				<A HREF="#Configure">configuration utility</A>. To view 
				information about the data shown in the column, click on
				the column's label.
				<P>
				To select a different gene in the table, click on the name of
				the gene. The Browser will move the gene entry to the top of the

				the gene. Ensembl is an automatic gene prediction pipeline and
				a major genome database and web site run by the Sanger
				Institute and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).
				It is especially effective at mapping genes that are known 
				in one organism to another organism. Compared to other gene
				predictions, those of Ensembl tend to have high specificity 
				but low sensitivity to genes not already associated with
				characterized mRNA or protein sequence. Clicking on an 
				Ensembl ID displays the Ensembl GeneView page for the gene.<BR> 
                              	<LI>  
				<B>E-Value column:</B> Shows the Blastp e-value (expectation value) 
				between each gene and the selected gene. The greater the 
				similarity of two proteins, the lower the e-value is. 
				Identical long proteins have an e-value of 0. 
				Formally, an e-value is the number of other known genes that 
				are expected to have at least this level of homology by chance.
				An e-value of less than 0.1 can be safely interpreted as the
				probability that a match this good would occur merely by
				chance.  For more information about how the e-value was 
				calculated, click on the E-Value column label.<BR>

				<A NAME="Expression"></A>
				<B>Expression columns:</B> Show the ratio of 		
				expression of the gene in selected tissues or life cycle stages
				to the expression of the gene overall. 
				A gene that is more highly expressed is colored red, and a less 
				expressed gene is shown in green. The values are colored on a 
				logarithmic scale. This coloring is standard, but is the opposite 
				of what a naive user might expect: in this case, red means go 
				and green means stop! Black indicates that a gene is neither 
				over nor under expressed in the tissue. Uncolored boxes 
				(white on most browsers) represent missing data. 
				Various attributes of the expression column displays may be configured 
				using the <A HREF="#Configure">configuration utility</A>. Depending on the 
				organism, the user
				may adjust the color scheme and brightness, toggle between expression
				ratio and absolute expression values, and increase or decrease the 
				level of detail shown. In particular, color-blind users 
				may wish to switch the coloring from red/green to yellow/blue.

				<P>
				The Gene Family Browser is highly configurable, allowing you
				to fine-tune the display to show just the genes and data
				columns in which you're interested in an order that best suits your research
				needs. Most of the configuration is controlled through settings on
				the Configuration page, accessed via the <em>configure</em> button at
				the top of the Browser page.
				<P>
				<B>Changing the number of rows displayed</B><BR>
				To increase or decrease the number of rows shown in the table, pick a
				new value from the <em>display</em> pull-down menu, then click the <em>Go!</em> 
				button.
				<P>
                                <B>Changing the number of columns displayed</B><BR>
                                By default, the Browser shows only a small subset of the
				table columns available for the genome. You can view the full list of columns,
				or add or remove columns from your display, on the Configuration page.
				<P>The configuration table shows all the
				columns available for the currently-selected genome, listed in left-to-right
				display order. To add or remove a column from the Browser display, click the
				<em>On</em> checkbox to toggle the setting (a check indicates that the column
				is displayed). To quickly change the <em>On</em> settings of all columns,
				click the <em>Hide All</em> or <em>Show All</em> button at the top of the page. Click the 
				<em>Submit</em> button to display the changes in the Browser.
				<P>
				<B>Changing the column positions</B><BR>
				In addition to adding or removing columns, it is 
				also possible to move the columns to the left or right within the Browser
				table. The order of the column names in the configuration table indicates the
				current relative position of the columns in the Browser display from left to
				right. To shift a column one position to the left, click the <em>up</em> arrow in the
				item's <em>Position</em> column. Similarly, click the <em>down</em> arrow to shift a 
				column to the right. When you have finished making changes, click the <em>Submit</em>
				button.
				<P>
				<B>Changing the expression colors</B><BR>
				By default, the gene expression ratios are shown using a red/green color 
				scheme,
				where red indicates a gene that is more highly expressed and green corresponds
				to less expression. Color-blind users may find it helpful to switch the 
				coloring from red/green to yellow/blue. To do so, select the &quot;yellow high/blue
				low&quot; option from the <em>Expression ratio colors</em> pull-down menu on the 
				Configuration page, then click the <em>Submit</em> button.
				<P>
				<B>Changing the brightness of expression colors</B><BR>
				To increase or decrease the brightness of the colors in an expression 
				column, edit the <em>brightness</em> value for the corresponding entry in the 
				configuration table. Values greater than 1.0 increase the brightness, while 
				those less than 1.0 dim the color. Click the <em>Submit</em> button to display the 
				new values.
				<P>
				<B>Changing the type of tissue data shown in expression columns</B><BR>
				By default, the expression columns show the median ratio of expression
				of a gene in a small selected set of tissues. Use the the <em>tissues</em> 
				pull-down menu to configure the tissue display for the column. 
				The &quot;all replicas&quot; option will show the value
				of each individual experimental replica of each tissue. The &quot;median 
				of replicas&quot; option displays a single value for each tissue that 
				represents the median of all replicas for that tissue.
				<P>
				<B>Toggling between ratio and absolute expression values </B><BR>
				By default, expression columns show the ratio of expression of a gene relative
				to expression of the gene overall. To view absolute expression values instead,
				select the &quot;absolute&quot; option from the <em>values</em> pull-down menu. 
				<P>
				<B>Displaying splicing variants</B><BR>
				By default, the Browser shows only one splicing variant: the one that produces
				the largest protein. To show all splicing variants, click the <em>Show all 
				splicing variants</em> checkbox. Note that in most cases, the column values
				(and sometimes the names) will be identical across variants.
				<P>
				<B>Restoring the default settings</B><BR>
				At any time during your Browser session, you can restore the Browser table
				to its default layout by clicking the <em>Default</em> button on the Configuration page,
				then clicking <em>Submit</em>.
				<P>
				<B>Saving a configuration for future use</B><BR>
				The Browser configuration utility allows you to store multiple configurations
				for use in future sessions. This feature is particularly useful if you require
				different layouts for different research uses.
				To save the current configuration of the Browser layout, click the <em>Save</em> button
				on the Configuration page. Type in a name for the configuration in the text
				box at the top of the page, then click <em>Save</em>. 
				<P>
				<B>Loading a previously-saved configuration</B><BR>
				Once you have saved a configuration, you can load it back into your Browser
				in a future session. To load a configuration, click the <em>Load</em> button on the
				Configuration page. The Browser will display a list of the names of your saved 
				configurations. Click on a name to highlight it, then click <em>Load</em> to 
				reconfigure your Browser based on the saved settings.
				<P>
				<B>Viewing a list of saved configurations</B><BR>
				To display a list of configurations that you have saved, click the <em>Save</em> button
				on the Configuration page. If you have any saved configurations, the Browser 
				will display an <em>Existing Setups</em> list that shows the configuration names. To
				permanently remove a configuration from the list, click on the name to 
				highlight it, then click the <em>Delete Existing Setup</em> button.

				<P>
				The Gene Family Browser's gene filtering capabilities provide a versatile
				way to fine-tune the Browser display to show just the genes in which you are
				interested. Filters are applied to individual gene fields, and may be
				combined to increase the specificity of the search. To access the Filter page, 
				click the <em>filter</em> button at the top of the Browser page. 
				<P>
				At any time during the filter setup process, you can click the <em>List Names</em>
				button on the Filter page to view a list of genes
				that will be returned when the current filter settings are applied to the
				genome. You may find this list helpful in fine-tuning the filter. 
				<P>
				<B>Filtering based on matching one or more terms</B><BR>
				Filters based on names, IDs, or other words restrict the display 
				to only those genes that match one or more terms typed into the 
				<em>search</em> text box. 
				Examples of values that can be filtered on this basis include the gene
				name, RefSeq accession number, gene description, coding SNPs, and GO terms.
			 	<P>
				This search supports wildcard matching on &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot;.
				Multiple terms must be separated by a space or tab. For example,
				the search criteria "HOXA9 FOX*" on the gene name field returns the gene 
				named HOXA9 and any gene whose name begins with the letters &quot;FOX&quot;. 
				When searching on fields that consist of values containing more than one 
				word (GO terms, coding SNPs, Pfam domains, and gene descriptions), the 
				multi-word
				elements must be enclosed in single quotes. For instance, a search on the
				description phrase &quot;forkhead box protein&quot; should be entered as
				'forkhead box protein'.
				Use the 
				&quot;any&quot; and &quot;all&quot; options to determine whether the search should 
				return any gene that matches any term (&quot;any&quot;) or only those genes that 
				match all terms (&quot;all&quot;).
				<P>
				To facilitate searching on multiple terms, the Browser provides
				the option to paste in or upload a list of search terms. To paste in a list
				of terms, click the filter's <em>Paste List</em> button, then paste or type the 
				terms into the text box. Terms must be separated by a space, a tab, or be 
				entered on separate lines, and may not include wildcards. When you have 
				completed the list, click the Submit button to return to the main Filter page.
				The file upload utility - accessed via the <em>Upload List</em> button - has a similar
				functionality.
				<P>
				<B>Filtering based on numerical ranges</B><BR>
				Several of the gene fields can be filtered by specifying a numerical range
				within which the value must fall. Examples of
				fields in this category include expression ratios, Blastp data, and genome
				position. To use this type of filter, enter the minimum and maximum
				values delimiting the range in which you are interested. In some cases, the
				range of valid values is indicated in the filter box. 
				<P>
				The genome position filter requires the name of a chromosome (in the 
				format <em>chrN</em>) in addition
				to the chromosomal start and end positions. To list all genes on a chromosome,
				enter only the chromosome name.
				<P>
				Expression filters include &quot;any&quot; and &quot;all&quot; options to 
				determine whether the search should 
				return a gene if any of the tissue expression values meet the minimum and
				maximum criteria (&quot;any&quot;) or only if all tissue expression values meet 
				the search criteria (&quot;all&quot;).
				<P>
				<B>Saving filter settings</B><BR>
				The Browser provides a mechanism for saving filter settings for use in future
				sessions. To preserve the current filter configuration, click the <em>Save Filter</em>
				button on the Filter page. Type in a name for the filter, then click <em>Save</em>
				to save the filter and return to the Filter page.
				<P>
				<B>Loading a saved filter</B><BR>
				Once a filter configuration has been saved, you can retrieve it in later
				sessions by loading it back into your Browser. To load the saved filter
				settings, click the <em>Load Filter</em> button on the Filter page. Click on the
				name of the filter you wish to load, then click the <em>Load</em> button. Click
				the <em>Submit</em> button on the Filter page to apply the filter settings to the
				Browser.
				<P>
				<B>Viewing a list of saved filters</B><BR>
				To display a list of filter settings that you have saved, click the <em>Save</em> button
				on the Filter page. If you have any saved filters, the Browser 
				will display an <em>Existing Setups</em> list that shows the filter names. To
				permanently remove a filter from the list, click on the name to 
				highlight it, then click the <em>Delete Existing Setup</em> button.

				The Browser's graphical presentation of data facilitates the visual
				observation of relationships and patterns among the genes in the
				display. However, it is often useful to convert the data to a text-based
				format that can be easily saved to a file or loaded into another program,
				database, or spreadsheet for further analysis. The Browser provides
				a mechanism for saving the current display in a tab-delimited text file or
				showing a text-based view of the sequence underlying the current display.
				<P>
				<B>Creating text-based output</B><BR>
				To output the current Browser table as text, click the text button at the
				top of the Browser page. The Browser will display each row of table data 
				on a separate tab-delimited line.
				<P>
				<B>Viewing the underlying sequence</B><BR>
				To display the protein, mRNA, or genomic sequence underlying the current
				Browser table, click the sequence button at the top of the Browser
				page. On the Get Sequence page, select the desired sequence configuration 
				settings that you'd like, then click the <em>Get Sequence</em> button. The Browser will 
				display a text-based list of FASTA format records for each gene displayed
				in the table. The FASTA records may be cut and pasted into
				Blat for further study.
