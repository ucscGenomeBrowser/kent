<H2>Description</H2>
This track shows the boundaries of genes and the direction of
transcription as deduced from clustering spliced ESTs and mRNAs
against the genome.  When there are many spliced variants
of the same gene, this track shows the variant that
spans the greatest distance in the genome.  

<H2>Method</H2>
ESTs and mRNAs from Genbank are aligned against the genome
with the BLAT program, and filtered to keep only those alignments
that have at least 97.5% base identity within the 
aligning blocks.  When multiple alignments occur, only the
alignments with a percentage identity within 0.2% of the
best alignment are kept.  ESTs that align without any
introns are discarded.  Blocks that are less than 130 bases
and are not next to an intron are discarded.   Blocks smaller
than 10 bases are discarded.   The orientations of the 
ESTs and mRNAs are deduced from the GT/AG splice sites
at the introns,  and ESTs and mRNAs with overlapping blocks
on the same strand are merged into clusters.  Only the
extent and orientation of the clusters are shown here.

This track was generated at UCSC by Jim Kent using data
submitted to Genbank by scientists worldwide.
