<h1>hic Track Format</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> The UCSC tools currently support hic versions 6-8.
The <a target="_blank" href="hgHicTrackHelp.html">hic track configuration</a> help page
describes hic display options.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Data/#hic-files" target="_blank">Hic format</a>
is an indexed binary format designed to permit fast random access to contact matrix heatmaps.  The
format was designed by the <a href="https://www.aidenlab.org/" target="_blank">Aiden Lab</a>
at <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank">Baylor College of Medicine</a>. More information
on the hic format itself can be found in the documentation on
<a href="https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Data/#hic-files" target="_blank">Github</a>.
</p>
<p>
The format is used for displaying chromatin conformation data in the browser. This format is useful
for displaying interactions at a scale and depth that exceeds what can be easily visualized with the
interact and bigInteract formats. After running a chromatin conformation experiment such as
<em>in situ</em> Hi-C, researchers can pass their results through the
<a href="https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki" target="_blank">Juicer</a> pipeline to
produce a hic file. Due to the large size of many of these files, UCSC is not able to support
direct upload via our Custom Track interface. Instead, users should place their Hic files in a 
web-accessible space and enter the URL as a bigDataUrl. If you do not have access to a 
web-accessible server and need hosting space for your Hic files, please see the 
<a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html#Hosting">Hosting</a> section of the Track Hub Help documentation.</p>

<h2>Generating a hic track</h2>
<p>
The typical workflow for generating a hic custom track is this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Prepare your data by processing it with the <a href= "https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki"
  target="_blank">Juicer</a> pipeline to create a file in the hic format.
  </li>
  <li>
  Move the hic file (<em>my.hic</em>) to an http, https, or ftp location.</li>
  <li>
  Construct a <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom track</a> using a single 
  <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#TRACK">track line</a>. The basic version of the track line will look 
  something like this:
  <pre><code>track type=hic name="My HIC" bigDataUrl=<em>http://myorg.edu/mylab/my.hic</em></code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  Paste the custom track line into the text box in the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" 
  target="_blank">custom track management page</a>, click &quot;submit&quot; and view in the Genome 
  Browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Parameters for hic custom track definition lines</h2>
<p>
All options are placed in a single line separated by spaces (lines are broken only for readability 
here):</p>
<pre><code><strong>track type=hic bigDataUrl=</strong><em>http://...</em>
    <strong>name=</strong><em>track_label</em>
    <strong>description=</strong><em>center_label</em> 
    <strong>visibility=</strong><em>display_mode</em>
    <strong>db=</strong><em>db</em></code></pre>
<p>
Note if you copy/paste the above example, you must remove the line breaks.
Click <a href="examples/hicExample.txt">here</a> for a text version that you can paste 
without editing.</p>
<p>
The track type and bigDataUrl are REQUIRED:</p>
<pre><code><strong>type=hic bigDataUrl=</strong><em>http://myorg.edu/mylab/my.hic</em></strong> </code></pre>
<p>
The remaining settings are OPTIONAL:</p>
<pre><code><strong>name            </strong><em>track label                </em> # default is "User Track"
<strong>description     </strong><em>center label               </em> # default is "User Supplied Track"
<strong>visibility      </strong><em>full|dense|hide            </em> # default is hide (will also take numeric values 4|1|0)
<strong>db              </strong><em>genome database            </em> # e.g. hg19 for Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37) </code></pre>
<p>Note that hic tracks currently only support the full, dense, and hide visibility modes.
The <a target="_blank" href="hgHicTrackHelp.html">hic track configuration</a> help page
describes the hic track configuration page options.</p>

<h3>Example #1</h3>
<p>
In this example, you will create a custom track for a hic file that is already on a public 
internet server &mdash; data from an in situ Hi-C experiment on the HMEC cell line
mapped to the hg19 assembly (Rao et al., 2014).</p>
<p>
The line breaks inserted in the track line for readability must be removed before submitting 
this entry as a Custom Track. Click <a href="examples/hicExampleOne.txt">here</a> for a 
text version you can paste without editing. The &quot;browser&quot; line above is used set 
the default view to a region of chromosome 21.</p>
<pre><code>browser position chr21:32,000,000-35,000,000
track type=hic name="hic Example One" description="hic Ex. 1: in situ Hi-C on HMEC"
    db=hg19 visibility=dense
    bigDataUrl=http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/bbi/hic/GSE63525_HMEC_combined.hic</code></pre>
<p>
Paste the &quot;browser&quot; line and &quot;track&quot; line into the 
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" target="_blank">custom track management page</a> for the human 
assembly hg19 (Feb. 2009), then click the &quot;submit&quot; button. On the following page, click 
the &quot;chr21&quot; link in the custom track listing to view the hic track in the Genome 
Browser.</p>

<h3>Example #2</h3>
<p>
In this example, you will load a hub that has hic data described in a hub's trackDb.txt file.
First, navigate to the <a href="hubQuickStart.html" target="_blank">Basic Hub Quick Start Guide</a>
and review an introduction to hubs.</p>
<p>
Visualizing hic files in hubs involves creating three text files: <em>hub.txt</em>, 
<em>genomes.txt</em>, and <em>trackDb.txt</em>. The browser is passed a URL to the top-level 
<em>hub.txt</em> file that points to the related <em>genomes.txt</em> and <em>trackDb.txt</em> 
files. The <em>trackDb.txt</em> file contains stanzas for each track that outlines the details 
and type of each track to display, such as these lines for a hic file located at the bigDataUrl 
location:</p>
<pre><code>track hic1
bigDataUrl http://http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/bbi/hic/GSE63525_GM12878_insitu_primary+replicate_combined.hic
shortLabel hic example
longLabel This hic file shows in situ Hi-C data from Rao et al. (2014) on the GM12878 cell line
type hic
visibility dense</code></pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> there is now a <code>useOneFile on</code> hub setting that allows the hub
properties to be specified in a single file. More information about this setting can be found on the
<a href="./hgTracksHelp.html#UseOneFile" target="_blank">Genome Browser User Guide</a>.</p>
<p>
Here is a direct link to the <em><a href="examples/hubDirectory/hg19/trackDb.txt" 
target="_blank">trackDb.txt</a></em> file to see more information about this example hub, and below 
is a direct link to visualize the hub in the browser, where this example hic file displays in dense 
mode alongside the other tracks in this hub. You can find more Track Hub hic display options on the 
<a href="trackDb/trackDbHub.html#hic" target="_blank">Track Database (trackDb) Definition 
Document</a> page.</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Data with Others</h2>
<p>
If you would like to share your hic data track with a colleague, there are a couple of options.
One method is to load your data track into the UCSC Genome Browser and then create a saved session
by following the instructions <a href="https://hgwdev-jcasper.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgSessionHelp.html#Create">here</a>.
If you are looking for a more automated method of sharing data, you may be interested to learn how to create
a direct URL that loads custom data files.  For a demonstration of this, see <strong>Example 6</strong> on the
<a href="customTrack.html#SHARE">custom tracks</a> page.</p>
