This region was detected as a genomic duplication within the golden path. 
Duplications of 99% or greater similarity, which are likely missed overlaps, 
are shown as red. Duplications of 98% - 99% similarity are shown as yellow. 
Duplications of 90% - 98% similarity are shown as shades of gray. Cut off 
values were at least 1 kb of total sequence aligned (containing at least 500 bp 
non-RepeatMasked sequence) and at least 90% sequence identity.  For a
