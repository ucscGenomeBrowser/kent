<H2>Description</H2>

<p> This track shows potential enhancers whose activity was experimentally validated in transgenic mice.
Most of these noncoding elements were selected for testing based on their extreme conservation in
other vertebrates or epigenomic evidence (ChIP-Seq) of putative enhancer marks. More information
can be found on the <a href="http://enhancer.lbl.gov" target="_blank">VISTA Enhancer Browser</a>
page.

<h2> Display Conventions and Configuration </h2>
<p> Items appearing in <b><font color="red">red</font></b> (positive) indicate that a reproducible
pattern was observed in the in vivo enhancer assay. Items appearing in
<b><font color="blue">blue</font></b> (negative) indicate that NO reproducible pattern was observed
in the  in vivo enhancer assay.  Note that this annotation refers only to the single developmental
timepoint that was tested in this screen (e11.5) and does not exclude the possibility that this
region is a reproducible enhancer active at earlier or later timepoints in development.

<h4>Enhancer Candidate Identification</h4>
<p> Most enhancer candidate sequences are identified by extreme evolutionary sequence conservation or
by ChIP-seq.  Detailed information related to enhancer identification by extreme evolutionary
conservation can be found in the following publications:

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
VISTA Enhancers data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> and cross-referenced with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For programmatic access,
the track can be accessed using the Genome Browser&apos;s
<a href="../../goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>.
ReMap annotations can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/vistaEnhancers">Genome Browser's download server</a>
as a bigBed file. This compressed binary format can be remotely queried through
command line utilities. Please note that some of the download files can be quite large.</p>
