<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of the $organism genome with itself, using
a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps than traditional
affine gap scoring systems. The system can also tolerate gaps
in both sets of sequence simultaneously.  After filtering out the 
&quot;trivial&quot; alignments produced when identical locations of the 
genome map to one another (e.g. chr<em>N</em> mapping to chr<em>N</em>), 
the remaining alignments point out areas of duplication within the 
$organism genome. The pseudoautosomal regions of chrX and chrY are an 
exception: in this assembly, these regions have been copied from chrX into 
chrY, resulting in a large amount of self chains aligning in these positions 
on both chromosomes. </P>
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.  Single lines indicate 
gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the query assembly or an 
insertion in the target assembly.  Double lines represent more complex gaps 
that involve substantial sequence in both the query and target assemblies. 
This may result from inversions, overlapping deletions, an abundance of local 
mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one of the assemblies. In cases where 
multiple chains align over a particular region of the $organism genome, the 
chains with single-lined gaps are often due to processed pseudogenes, while 
chains with double-lined gaps are more often due to paralogs and unprocessed 
pseudogenes. </P>
<P>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</P>
<P>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The genome was aligned to itself using blastz. Trivial alignments were 
filtered out, and the remaining alignments were converted into axt format
using the lavToAxt program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which 
organizes all alignments between a single target chromosome and a single
query chromosome into a group and creates a kd-tree out of the gapless 
subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program was then run over 
the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these blocks.

$matrix

Chains scoring below a minimum score of 2,000 were discarded;
the remaining chains are displayed in this track.<BR><BR>
