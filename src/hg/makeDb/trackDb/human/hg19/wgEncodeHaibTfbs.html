<h2> Description </h2>
<p>This track displays binding sites of the specified transcription factors
in the given cell types as identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq &mdash; see Johnson DS,
<em>et al.</em>, 2007 and Fields S, 2007).
</P><P>
The ChIP-Seq method was used to assay chromatin fragments bound by
specific or general transcription factors as described below.  DNA isolated
by ChIP-Seq was size-selected (~225 bp) and sequenced.  Short
reads of 25-36 bp were mapped to the human reference genome, and  enriched 
regions of high read density relative to a total input chromatin
control reads were identified.
</P></P>
The sequence reads with quality scores (fastq files) and alignment 
coordinates (BAM files) from these experiments are available for download.
</P>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
The subtracks in this track are grouped by transcription factor
targeted antibody and by cell type.  For each experiment (cell type vs.
antibody), the following views are included:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD>Sites with the greatest evidence of transcription
factor binding, calculated as enriched regions of high read density 
in the ChIP experiment relative to total input chromatin control reads by
<A HREF="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/00README.html" TARGET=_BLANK>MACS</A>
(Zhang Y, <em>et al.</em>, 2008).</DD>
<DT><I>Raw Signal</I></DT><DD> A continuous signal which indicates density of
aligned reads.  
The sequence reads were extended to the size-selected length (225 bp),
and the read density computed as reads per million</DD>

</p>
<a name="Methods"></a><h2> Methods </h2>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an antibody. The Protein:DNA
crosslinks were then reversed and the DNA fragments were recovered and sequenced.
Please see protocol notes below and go <A HREF="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab/
protocols" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A> for the most current version of the protocol.
Biological replicates from each experiment were completed.
</p></p>
Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Genome
Analyzer I or an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx according to the
manufacturer's recommendations.  
Sequence data produced by the Illumina data pipeline software were quality
filtered and then mapped to NCBI Build37 (hg19) using the integrated Eland
software; 32 nt of the sequence reads were used for alignment;
up to two mismatches were tolerated; reads that mapped to
multiple sites in the genome were discarded.
</p><p>
To identify likely binding
sites, peak calling was applied to the aligned sequence data sets using
Model-based Analysis of Chip-Seq 
<A HREF="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/00README.html" TARGET=_BLANK>MACS</A>
(Zhang Y,<em> et al.</em>, 2008).  MACS models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags 
empirically, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted 
binding sites.  
MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to capture local biases in the genome,
allowing for  more robust predictions (Zhang Y,<em> et al.</em>, 2008).

<h4> Protocol Notes </h4>
<p> 
Several changes and improvements were made to the original ChIP-Seq protocol
(Jonshon <em>et al.</em>,2008).  The major differences between protocols are the number
of cells and magnetic beads used for IP, the method of sonication used to 
fragment DNA, and the number of cycles of PCR used to amplify the 
sequencing library.  The most current protocol used by the Myers lab
can be found <A HREF="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab/protocols" TARGET=_BLANK>
here</A>.  The protocol field for each file denotes the
version of the protocol used as being PCR1x, PCR2x or a version number
(for examples, v041610.1).

</p><p> The sequencing libraries labeled as PCR2x were made with two rounds
of amplification (25 and 15 cycles) and those labeled as PCR1x were made with
one 15-cycle round of amplification.  These experiments were
completed prior to January 2010 and were originally aligned to NCBI Build36
(hg18).  They have been re-aligned to NCBI Build37 (hg19) with the 
<A HREF="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml" TARGET=_BLANK>
Bowtie</A> software (Langmead,<em> et al.</em>, 2009) for this data release.
The libraries labeled with a protocol version number were competed after
January 2010 and were only aligned to NCBI Build37 (hg19).  Please
refer to the <A HREF="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab/protocols" 
TARGET=_BLANK>Myers Lab website</A> for details on each protocol version.
</p>

<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>
The <A HREF="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/00README.html"
TARGET=_BLANK>MACS</A> peak caller was used to call significant peaks on the
individual replicates of a ChIP-Seq experiment. Afterwards, the
irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) method, developed by
Li <em> et al.</em> (submitted), was used to quantify the consistency between pairs
of ranked peaks lists from replicates.  The IDR methods uses a model that
assumes that the ranked lists of peaks in a pair of replicates consist of
two groups - a reproducible group and an irreproducible group. 
In general, the signals in the reproducible group are more consistent (i.e.
with a larger rank correlation coefficient) and are ranked
higher than the irreproducible group.  The proportion of peaks that
belong to the irreproducible component and the correlation of the reproducible 
component are estimated adaptively from the data.  The model also provides
an IDR score for each peak, which reflects the posterior probability
of the peak belonging to the irreproducible group.  The 
aligned reads were pooled from all replicates and the MACS peak caller was used to call 
significant peaks on the pooled data.  Only datasets containing at
least 100 peaks passing the IDR threshold are considered valid and submitted
for release.
