<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/" 
TARGET=_BLANK>AceView</A> gene models constructed from
cDNA by Danielle and Jean Thierry-Mieg at NCBI, using their AceView program.
</P> 
<p>
AceView is unique in that it defines the genes genome-wide by using only,
but exhaustively, the experimental cDNA sequences from the species itself. 
The analysis exploits sophisticated cDNA-to-genome co-alignment algorithms 
and the quality of the genome sequence to provide a comprehensive and 
non-redundant representation of the GenBank, dbEST, GSS, Trace and RefSeq 
cDNA sequences. The next release, later in 2011, will also include the data 
deposited in SRA (or assimilated public repository) as part of the SEQC 
collaborative project led by Leming Shi from FDA and involving 
high throughput RNA sequences provided by Helicos, Illumina, 
LifeTech SOLiD and Roche 454, which greatly refine and enrich 
the gene models. 
</P>
<p>
In a way, the AceView transcripts represent a fully annotated non-redundant
&quot;nr&quot; view of the public RNAs, minus cloning artefacts, contaminations and 
bad quality sequences. AceView transcripts currently represent a 10 times 
compaction relative to the raw data, with minimal loss of sequence 
information.
</P>
<P>
87% of the public RNA sequences are coalesced into AceView alternative 
transcripts and genes, thereby identifying close to twice as many main 
genes as there are "known genes" in both human and mouse. 18% to 25% of 
the spliced genes appear non-coding, in mouse and human respectively. 
Alternative transcripts are prominent in both species. The typical human gene
produces on average eight distinct alternatively spliced forms from three 
promoters and with three non-overlapping terminal exons. 
It has on average three cassette exons and four internal donor or acceptor 
sites. The AceView site further proposes a thorough biological annotation 
of the reconstructed genes, including association to diseases and tissue 
specificity of the alternative transcripts.
</P>
<P>
AceView combines respect for the experimental data with extensive quality 
control. Evaluated in the ENCODE regions, AceView transcripts are close to 
indistinguishable from the manually curated Gencode reference genes 
(see Thierry-Mieg, 2006, or compare the two tracks in the Genome Browser), 
but over the entire genome the number of transcripts exceeds Havana/Vega 
by a factor of three and RefSeq by a factor of six.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
The millions of cDNA sequences available from the public databases 
(GenBank, dbEST, GSS, Traces, etc.) are aligned cooperatively on the 
genome sequence, taking care to keep the paired 5' and 3' reads from 
single clones associated in the same transcript. 
Useful information about tissue, stage, publications, isolation procedure 
and so on is gathered. AceView alignments on the genome use knowledge 
on sequencing errors gained from analyzing sequencing traces and cooperative 
refinements. They are usually obtained over the entire length of the EST 
or mRNA (average 98.8% aligned, 0.2% mismatches in mRNAs or 95.5% aligned, 
1.4% mismatches in ESTs).</P>
<P>
Multiple alignments are evaluated and the sequences are stringently 
kept only in their best position genome-wide. 
Less than 1% of the mRNAs and less than 2% of the ESTs will ultimately be 
aligned in more than one gene, usually in the ~1% closely repeated genes.</P>
<P>
The cDNA sequences are then processed and cleaned: the vectors and polyA are 
clipped, the reads presumably submitted on the wrong strand are flipped, 
and the small insertion or deletion polymorphisms are identified.
Eventual cDNA clone rearrangements or anomalous alignments are flagged 
and filtered (akin to manually) so as not to lose unique valuable 
information while avoiding pollution of the database with poorly supported 
anomalous data.</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, cDNA libraries are still far from saturation, 
because up until high throughput sequencing, cDNA sequences were 
difficult to obtain. Yet they are the cleanest and most reliable 
information to define the molecular genes. For this reason, a single 
good-quality cDNA sequence, aligned with standard introns on the genome, 
is considered sufficient evidence for a given spliced mRNA  fragment. 
In contrast, un-spliced  alignments could reflect genomic contamination 
of cDNA libraries, and non-coding single exon genes are reported 
only if they are supported by six or more accessions. 
The numerous single exon TARs supported by 5 or fewer cDNAs belong to what 
is termed &lsquo;the cloud&rsquo; (not displayed on the UCSC Genome Browser,
but annotated in AceView and downloadable separately from the 
<A HREF=
"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/Download/Downloads.html"
TARGET=_blank> ftp site</A>).</P>

<P>
The cDNA sequences are clustered into a minimal number of alternative 
transcript variants, preferring partial transcripts to artificially 
completed ones. Sequences are concatenated by simple contact, 
but the combinatorics are avoided by allowing each cDNA accession 
to contribute to a single alternative variant, preferably one 
where it merges silently without bringing any new sequence information. 
As a result, all shorter reads compatible with a full-length mRNA will be 
absorbed in that transcript and will not be used to extend other incompatible
transcripts.</P>

<P>
About 70% of the variants, clearly identified on the Acembly site, 
have their entire protein coding region supported by a single cDNA; 
the others may be illicit concatenations that may be split and associated 
differently when more data become available. The main sequence of the 
transcript used in the annotation is that of the footprint of the transcript 
on the genome, which is of better quality than the mRNAs: this procedure 
corrects up to 2% of sequencing errors. Single base insertion, deletion, 
transition or transversion is shown graphically in the mRNA view, 
where frequent SNPs become evident.</P> 
<P>
Putative protein-coding regions are predicted from the mRNA sequence and 
annotated using BlastP, PFAM, Psort2, and comparison to AceView proteins 
from other species. The best proteins are scored (see the <a href="http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/FAQandOverview/AboutAceView.htm
#HelpOverview" target="_blank">Aceview Overview</a> on the Acembly site) and transcripts 
are putatively proposed to be protein-coding or non-coding.</P>
<P>
Expression, cDNA support, tissue specificity, sequences of alternative 
transcripts, introns and exons, alternative promoters, alternative 
exons and alternative polyadenylation sites are evaluated and annotated 
in rich tables on the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/
Acembly/" target="_blank">Acembly</a> web site.</P>
<P>
The reconstructed alternative transcripts are then grouped into genes 
if they share at least one exact intron boundary or if they have 
substantial sequence overlap (80% of the sequence of one included 
in the other). Coding and non-coding genes are defined, and genes 
in antisense are flagged.</P>
<P>
AceView genes are matched by molecular contact to Entrez genes and 
named according to the Entrez Gene nomenclature. For novel genes not 
in Entrez, AceView creates new gene names that are maintained from 
release to release until the genes receive an official or Entrez gene 
name.</P>
<P>
Knowledge on each gene is annotated provided there is PubMed support. 
Selected functional annotations are gathered from other sources, 
including Entrez. In addition, candidate tested disease associations 
are extracted directly from PubMed, in addition to OMIM and GAD. 
Finally, lists of the most closely related genes by function, pathway, 
protein complex, GO annotation, disease, cellular localization or all 
criteria taken together are proposed, to stimulate research and 
development.</P>
