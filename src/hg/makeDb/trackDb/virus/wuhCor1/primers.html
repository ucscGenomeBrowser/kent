<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the locations of those primers in detection kits that match the
reference sequence. The primers were copied from 
<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17eucK_mSAGgYvxVCKJkbbYaogr2ofbhgW2f9W7K3oOA/edit#gid=636736390">
a spreadsheet</a> created by the project
<a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/opencovid19/home">
OpenCovid19</a>.
The initial version of the track used the FASTA file from <a href="https://tomeraltman.net/2020/04/05/all-public-primers.html" target=_blank">Design Flaws in COVID-19 Primers from Multiple International Labs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Most are RT-qPCR primer sets, sequencing primers have the prefix Seq1- or Seq2-. RT-qPCR sets consists of one forward, one reverse and one internal probe, as indicated by the names.</p>

<p>
As expected, the three control primers were not found at all: US-CDC-Control_RP-P, US-CDC-Control_RP-R, US-CDC-Control_RP-F.
</p>

<p>Here is a quick overview of the origin of the primers, please see the website and spreadsheet linked above for more details:</p>
