<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows short genetic variants
(up to approximately 50 base pairs) from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 153:
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs),
small insertions, deletions, and complex deletion/insertions (indels),
relative to the reference genome assembly.
Most variants in dbSNP are rare, not true polymorphisms,
and some variants are known to be pathogenic.
</p><p>
For hg38 (GRCh38), approximately 667 million distinct variants
(RefSNP clusters with rs# ids)
have been mapped to more than 702 million genomic locations
including alternate haplotype and fix patch sequences.
dbSNP remapped variants from hg38 to hg19 (GRCh37);
approximately 658 million distinct variants were mapped to
more than 683 million genomic locations
including alternate haplotype and fix patch sequences (not
all of which are included in UCSC's hg19).
</p>
<p>
This track includes four subtracks of variants:
  <ul>
    <li><b>All dbSNP (153)</b>: the entire set (683 million for hg19, 702 million for hg38)
    </li>
    <li><b>Common dbSNP (153)</b>: approximately 15 million variants with a minor allele
      frequency (MAF) of at least 1% (0.01) in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 dataset.
      Variants in the Mult. subset (below) are excluded.
    </li>
    <li><b>ClinVar dbSNP (153)</b>: approximately 455,000 variants mentioned in ClinVar.
      <b>Note:</b> that includes both benign and pathogenic (as well as uncertain) variants.
      Variants in the Mult. subset (below) are excluded.
    </li>
    <li><b>Mult. dbSNP (153)</b>: variants that have been mapped to multiple chromosomes,
      for example chr1 and chr2,
      raising the question of whether the variant is really a variant or just a difference
      between duplicated sequences.
      There are some exceptions in which a variant is mapped to more than one reference
      sequence, but not culled into this set:
      <ul>
        <li>A variant may appear in both X and Y
          pseudo-autosomal regions (PARs) without being included in this set.
        </li>
        <li>A variant may also appear in a main chromosome as well as an alternate haplotype
          or fix patch sequence assigned to that chromosome.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
A fifth subtrack highlights coordinate ranges to which dbSNP mapped a variant but with genomic
coordinates that are not internally consistent, i.e. different coordinate ranges were provided
when describing different alleles.  This can occur due to a bug with mapping variants from one
assembly sequence to another when there is an indel difference between the assembly sequences:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Map Err (153)</b>: around 120,000 mappings of 55,000 distinct rsIDs for hg19
      and 149,000 mappings of 86,000 distinct rsIDs for hg38.
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</h2>
<p>
SNVs and pure deletions are displayed as boxes covering the affected base(s).
Pure insertions are drawn as single-pixel tickmarks between
the base before and the base after the insertion.
</p><p>
Insertions and/or deletions in repetitive regions may be represented by a half-height box
showing uncertainty in placement, followed by a full-height box showing the number of deleted
bases, or a full-height tickmark to indicate an insertion.
When an insertion or deletion falls in a repetitive region, the placement may be ambiguous.
For example, if the reference genome contains "TAAAG" but some
individuals have "TAAG" at the same location, then the variant is a deletion of a single
A relative to the reference genome.
However, which A was deleted?  There is no way to tell whether the first, second or third A
was removed.
Different variant mapping tools may place the deletion at different bases in the reference genome.
To reduce errors in merging variant calls made with different left vs. right biases,
dbSNP made a major change in its representation of deletion/insertion variants in build 152.
Now, instead of assigning a single-base genomic location at one of the A's,
dbSNP expands the coordinates to encompass the whole repetitive region,
so the variant is represented as a deletion of 3 A's combined with an insertion of 2 A's.
In the track display, there will be a half-height box covering the first two A's,
followed by a full-height box covering the third A, to show a net loss of one base
but an uncertain placement within the three A's.
</p>
<p>
Variants are colored according to functional effect on genes annotated by dbSNP:
</p>

<p><b><font color=red>Protein-altering variants and splice site variants are
red</font></b>.
<br><b><font color=green>Synonymous codon variants are
green</font></b>.
<br><b><font color=blue>
Non-coding transcript or Untranslated Region (UTR) variants are
blue</font></b>.
</p>
<p>
On the track controls page, several variant properties can be included or excluded from
the item labels:
rs# identifier assigned by dbSNP,
reference/alternate alleles,
major/minor alleles (when available) and
minor allele frequency (when available).
Allele frequencies are reported independently by twelve projects

<h2>Data Sources and Methods</h2>
<p>
dbSNP has collected genetic variant reports from researchers worldwide for 
<a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2019/10/07/dbsnp-celebrates-20-years/"
   target=_blank>more than 20 years</a>.
Since the advent of next-generation sequencing methods and the population sequencing efforts
that they enable, dbSNP has grown exponentially, requiring a new data schema, computational pipeline,
web infrastructure, and download files.
(Holmes <em>et al.</em>)
The same challenges of exponential growth affected UCSC's presentation of dbSNP variants,
so we have taken the opportunity to change our internal representation and import pipeline.
Most notably, flanking sequences are no longer provided by dbSNP,
because most submissions have been genomic variant calls in VCF format as opposed to
independent sequences.
</p>
<p>
We downloaded JSON files available from dbSNP at
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/archive/b153/JSON/"
target=_blank>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/archive/b153/JSON/</a>,
extracted a subset of the information about each variant, and collated
it into a bigBed file using the
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/bigDbSnp.as"
target=_blank>bigDbSnp.as</a> schema with the information
necessary for filtering and displaying the variants,
as well as a separate file containing more detailed information to be
displayed on each variant's details page
(<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/dbSnpDetails.as"
target=_blank>dbSnpDetails.as</a> schema).

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> It is not recommeneded to use LiftOver to convert SNPs between assemblies,
and more information about how to convert SNPs between assemblies can be found on the following
<a href="/FAQ/FAQreleases.html#snpConversion">FAQ entry</a>.</p>
<p>
Since dbSNP has grown to include approximately 700 million variants, the size of the All dbSNP (153)
subtrack can cause the
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgTables" target=_blank>Table Browser</a> and
<a href="../../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator" target=_blank>Data Integrator</a>
to time out, leading to a blank page or truncated output,
unless queries are restricted to a chromosomal region, to particular defined regions, to a specific set 
of rs# IDs (which can be pasted/uploaded into the Table Browser),
or to one of the subset tracks such as Common (~15 million variants) or ClinVar (~0.5M variants).

  <li><b>bigBedToBed</b> converts the binary bigBed data to tab-separated text.
    Output can be restricted to a particular region by using the -chrom, -start
    and -end options.</li>
  <li><b>bigBedNamedItems</b> extracts rows for one or more rs# IDs.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Example: retrieve all variants in the region chr1:200001-200400</h4>

<pre><tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/snp/dbSnp153.bb -chrom=chr1 -start=200000 -end=200400 stdout</tt></pre>

<h4>Example: retrieve variant rs6657048</h4>

<pre><tt>bigBedNamedItems dbSnp153.bb rs6657048 stdout</tt></pre>

<h4>Example: retrieve all variants with rs# IDs in file myIds.txt</h4>

<pre><tt>bigBedNamedItems -nameFile dbSnp153.bb myIds.txt dbSnp153.myIds.bed</tt></pre>

<p>
The columns in the bigDbSnp/bigBed files and dbSnp153Details.tab.gz file are described in
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/bigDbSnp.as"
   target=_blank>bigDbSnp.as</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/dbSnpDetails.as"
   target=_blank>dbSnpDetails.as</a> respectively.
For columns that contain lists of allele frequency data, the order of projects
providing the data listed is as follows:
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/" target=_blank>1000Genomes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/" target=_blank>GnomAD exomes</a></li>

UCSC also has an
<a href="../goldenPath/help/api.html"
   target=_blank>API</a>
that can be used to retrieve values from a particular chromosome range.
</p><p>
A list of rs# IDs can be pasted/uploaded in the
<a href="hgVai" target=_blank>Variant Annotation Integrator</a>
tool to find out which genes (if any) the variants are located in,
as well as functional effect such as intron, coding-synonymous, missense, frameshift, etc.
