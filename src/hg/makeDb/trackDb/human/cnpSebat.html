<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 81 regions detected as putative copy number polymorphisms by representational 
oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA) in a population of 20 normal individuals. 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>

Following digestion of with BglII or HindIII, genomic DNA was hybridized to a 
custom array consisting of 85,000 oligonucleotide probes, 
probes were selected to be free of common repeats and have unique homology within the human genome. 

The average resolution of the array is ~35 kb, however only intervals in which 3 consecutive probes 
showed concordant signal were scored as CNPs. 

All hybridizations were performed in duplicate incorporating a dye-reversal, 
with the false positive rate estimated to be ~6%.
<br>
Note that CNP intervals as detailed by Sebat et al. (2004) were converted from the 
April 2003 (build33) into the July 2003 (build34) assembly using liftover.
