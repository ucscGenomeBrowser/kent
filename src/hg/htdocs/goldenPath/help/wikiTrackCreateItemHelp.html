Use the above form to add a new annotation to the Wiki Track.
<P>
The annotation position defaults to the region currently displayed in your 
browser window.
To change the position setting, type a new coordinate range in the 
<em>position</em> text box above. Alternatively, you can adjust the range
graphically by clicking &quot;cancel&quot; to return
to the browser window, adjusting the display position, then clicking on
the &quot;Make new entry&quot; link again to return to this form.

<P>
If you don't wish to specify an item name, simply leave the default 
<em>wikiDefaultName</em> label in place and a unique name will be assigned to 
your annotation after submission. 
</P>
<P>
Your new annotation will be tagged automatically with your genomewiki user 
name and a date/time stamp; there is no need to manually add this information.
Comments are maintained by the wiki system. 
We recommend that you use the genomewiki editing interface 
for subsequent changes to this annotation, particularly those 
that are extensive in nature. You can access this interface by clicking on
the annotation in the Wiki Track display.
