<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks contain mappings of single nucleotide variants
and small insertions and deletions (indels)
from the European Variation Archive
(<a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/" target="_blank">EVA</A>) 
for the $organism $db genome. The dbSNP database at NCBI no longer
hosts non-human variants.
</p>

<h2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</h2>
<p>
Variants are shown as single tick marks at most zoom levels.
When viewing the track at or near base-level resolution, the displayed
width of the SNP variant corresponds to the width of the variant in the
reference sequence. Insertions are indicated by a single tick mark displayed
between two nucleotides, single nucleotide polymorphisms are displayed as the
width of a single base, and multiple nucleotide variants are represented by a
block that spans two or more bases. The display is set to automatically collapse to 
dense visibility when there are more than 100k variants in the window. 
When the window size is more than 250k bp, the display is switched to density graph mode.
</p>

<h3>Searching, details, and filtering</h3>
<p>
Navigation to an individual variant can be accomplished by typing or copying
the variant identifier (rsID) or the genomic coordinates into the Position/Search box on the                                                       
Browser.</p>

<p>
A click on an item in the graphical display displays a page with data about
that variant.  Data fields include the Reference and Alternate Alleles, the
class of the variant as reported by EVA, the source of the data, the amino acid
change, if any, and the functional class as determined by UCSC's Variant Annotation
Integrator.
</p>

<p>Variants can be filtered using the track controls to show subsets of the 
data by either EVA Sequence Ontology (SO) term, UCSC-generated functional effect, or
by color, which bins the UCSC functional effects into general classes.</p>

<h3>Mouse-over</h3>
<p>
Mousing over an item shows the ucscClass, which is the consequence according to the
<a target="_blank" href="/cgi-bin/hgVai">Variant Annotation Integrator</a>, and
the aaChange when one is available, which is the change in amino acid in HGVS.p
terms. Items may have multiple ucscClasses, which will all be shown in the mouse-over
in a comma-separated list. Likewise, multiple HGVS.p terms may be shown for each rsID
separated by spaces describing all possible AA changes.</p>
<p>
Multiple items may appear due to different variant predictions on multiple gene transcripts.
For all organisms, the gene models used were the NCBI RefSeq curated when available, if not then 
ensembl genes, or finally, UCSC mappings of RefSeq if neither of the previous models was possible.
</p>

<h3>Track colors</h3>

<p>
Variants are colored according to the most potentially deleterious functional effect prediction
according to the Variant Annotation Integrator. Specific bins can be seen in the Methods section
below.

<h3>Sequence Ontology (SO)</h3>

<p>
Variants are classified by EVA into one of the following <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/">sequence ontology</a> terms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b>substitution</b> &mdash;
       A single nucleotide in the reference is replaced by another, alternate allele.
  <li> <b>deletion</b> &mdash; 
       One or more nucleotides are deleted.  The representation in the database is to
       display one additional nucleotide in both the Reference field (Ref) and the 
       Alternate Allele field (Alt).  E.g. a variant that is a deletion of an A
       maybe be represented as Ref = GA and Alt = G.
  <li> <b>insertion</b> &mdash; 
       One or more nucleotides are inserted.  The representation in the database is to
       display one additional nucleotide in both the Reference field (Ref) and the 
       Alternate Allele field (Alt).  E.g. a variant that is an insertion of a T may 
       be represented as Ref = G and Alt = GT.
  <li> <b>delins</b> &mdash; 
       Similar to a tandem repeat, in that the runs of Ref and Alt Alleles are of
       different length, except that there is more than one type of nucleotide,
       e.g., Ref = CCAAAAACAAAAACA, Alt = ACAAAAAC.
  <li> <b>multipleNucleotideVariant</b> &mdash; 
       More than one nucleotide is substituted by an equal number of different 
       nucleotides, e.g.,  Ref = AA, Alt = GC.
  <li> <b>sequence alteration</b> &mdash;
       A parent term meant to signify a deviation from another sequence. Can be
       assigned to variants that have not been characterized yet.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Data were downloaded from the European Variation Archive EVA
<a href="https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/eva/rs_releases/"
target="_blank">current_ids.vcf.gz</a> files corresponding to the proper assembly.</p>
<p>
Chromosome names were converted to UCSC-style
and the variants passed through the
<a target="_blank" href="/cgi-bin/hgVai">Variant Annotation Integrator</a> to
predict consequence. For every organism the NCBI RefSeq curated models were used when available, 
followed by ensembl genes, and finally UCSC mapping of RefSeq when neither of the previous models
were possible.</p>
<p>
Variants were then colored according to their predicted consequence in the following fashion:
<ul>
<li><b><font color=red>Protein-altering variants</font></b> and 
  <b><font color=red> splice site variants</font></b> 
- exon_loss_variant, frameshift_variant, 
inframe_deletion, inframe_insertion, initiator_codon_variant, missense_variant, 
splice_acceptor_variant, splice_donor_variant, splice_region_variant, stop_gained, 
stop_lost, coding_sequence_variant, transcript_ablation</li>
<li><b><font color=green>Synonymous codon variants</font></b>
- synonymous_variant, stop_retained_variant</li>
<li><b><font color=blue>Non-coding transcript </font></b> or
    <b><font color=blue>Untranslated Region (UTR) variants</font></b>
- 5_prime_UTR_variant,
3_prime_UTR_variant, complex_transcript_variant, non_coding_transcript_exon_variant</li>
<li><b>Intergenic and intronic variants</b> - upstream_gene_variant, downstream_gene_variant,
intron_variant, intergenic_variant, NMD_transcript_variant, no_sequence_alteration</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
Sequence Ontology (&quot;<a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release"
target="_blank">SO</a>:&quot;)
terms were converted to the variant classes, then the files were converted to BED,
and then bigBed format.
</p>
<p>
No functional annotations were provided by the EVA (e.g., missense, nonsense, etc).
These were computed using UCSC's Variant Annotation Integrator (Hinrichs, et al., 2016).
Amino-acid substitutions for missense variants are based
on RefSeq alignments of mRNA transcripts, which do not always match the amino acids
predicted from translating the genomic sequence.  Therefore, in some instances, the
variant and the genomic nucleotide and associated amino acid may be reversed.
E.g., a Pro &gt; Arg change from the perspective of the mRNA would be Arg &gt; Pro from
the perspective of the genomic sequence. Also, in bosTau9, galGal5, rheMac10,
and danRer11 the mitochondrial sequence was removed or renamed to match UCSC.
