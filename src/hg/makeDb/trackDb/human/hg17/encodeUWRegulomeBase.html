<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity, 
computed over each PCR amplicon using a locally-weighted least squares 
(LOWESS)-based algorithm described in Dorschner <em>et al</em> (2004).
The track is one of a set of tracks that annotate continuous DNaseI 
sensitivity measurements and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) over ENCODE 
regions. 
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the 
DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; that is a 
universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The data were produced using quantitative chromatin profiling (QCP) 
(Dorschner <em>et al.</em>).</P>
<P>
See the UW/Reg Amplicon track for a list of the cell lines/phenotypes studied
in these experiments.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
DNaseI sensitivity is expressed in standard units, where each
increment of 1 unit corresponds to an increase of 1SD from the baseline.
The displayed values are calculated as <TT>(copies in DNaseI-untreated / copies 
in DNaseI-treated)</TT>. Thus, increasing values represent increasing 
sensitivity.  Major DNaseI hypersensitive sites are readily identified as
peaks in the signal that exceed 2 SDs (corresponding to the ~95% confidence
bound on outliers).</P>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. 
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary; they provide a
visual cue for distinguishing the different cell lines/phenotypes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>. See the UW/Reg
Amplicon track description for more information.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
All data points represent the mean of four replicate measurements.</P>
