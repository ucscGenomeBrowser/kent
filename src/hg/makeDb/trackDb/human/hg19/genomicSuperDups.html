<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows regions detected as putative genomic duplications within the
golden path. The following display conventions are used to distinguish
levels of similarity:
<UL>
<LI>
Light to dark gray: 90 - 98% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark yellow: 98 - 99% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark orange: greater than 99% similarity 
<LI>
Red: duplications of greater than 98% similarity that lack sufficient 
Segmental Duplication Database evidence (most likely missed overlaps) 
</UL>
For a region to be included in the track, at least 1 Kb of the total 
sequence (containing at least 500 bp of non-RepeatMasked sequence) had to 
align and a sequence identity of at least 90% was required.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Segmental duplications play an important role in both genomic disease 
and gene evolution.  This track displays an analysis of the global 
organization of these long-range segments of identity in genomic sequence.
</P>

<P>Large recent duplications (>= 1 kb and >= 90% identity) were detected
by identifying high-copy repeats, removing these repeats from the genomic 
sequence ("fuguization") and searching all sequence for similarity.  The 
repeats were then reinserted into the pairwise alignments, the ends of 
alignments trimmed, and global alignments were generated.
For a full description of the "fuguization" detection method, see Bailey 
<em>et al.</em> (2001) in the References section below. This method has become 
known as WGAC (whole-genome assembly comparison); for example, see Bailey 
<em>et al.</em> (2002).
