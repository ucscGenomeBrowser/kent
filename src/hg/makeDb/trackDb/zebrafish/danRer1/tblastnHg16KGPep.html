<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains tBLASTn alignments of the peptides
from the predicted and known genes identified in the hg16 Known Genes track as 
of 21 July 2004.

<H2>Methods</H2>
The predicted proteins from the human knownGene track were aligned with 
the human genome using the tblastn. The proteins were obtained by 
merging annotation data from the kgXref table with the sequence and name found in 
the knownGenePep table. This resulted in a set of 40,115 protein sequences. 
The tblastn results were filtered using a threshold E-value of 1e-100 and, for 
each known gene peptide query, the top 5 hits to the $organism genome were kept.
