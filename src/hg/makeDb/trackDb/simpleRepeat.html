<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays simple tandem repeats (possibly imperfect) located
by <A HREF="http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.submit.options.html" 
TARGET=_blank>Tandem Repeats
Finder</A>, which is specialized for this purpose. These repeats can
occur within coding regions of genes and may be quite
polymorphic. Repeat expansions are sometimes associated with specific
diseases.</P>
