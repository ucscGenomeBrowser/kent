<P>
The August 2005 mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>) draft genome data was 
obtained from the Build 35 assembly by NCBI. See the Assembly Details section
below for information about the differences between Build 35 and Build 35.1.

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a 
sequenced genomic clone, an mRNA or EST or STS marker, or 
a cytological band, a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords 
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list 
provides examples of various types of position queries for the 
mouse genome. See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" 
TARGET=_blank>User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly Details</H3>
<P>
NCBI Build 35 includes approximately 2.6 Gb of sequence, of which about
2.2 Gb is finished sequence, contained in 
chromosomes 1-19, X, Y, M (mitochondrial DNA) and Un (unmapped clone contigs).
Chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and X are
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/contig/Build35/Build35CompGraphic.png"
TARGET=_blank>finished</A> in this assembly. 
More information about this version is available on the NCBI 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/contig/Build35.html"
TARGET=_blank>Build 35 Data</A> web page. </P>
<P>
Build 35 is a fifth-generation composite assembly. In this build, chromosomes 
1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10, and 12-19 were automatically assembled. The assembly is made
up of high throughput genome sequence (HTGS) phase 3 contigs, single fragment 
HTGS phase 2 contigs and whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs. On chromosome Y
in this assembly, only the short arm has reliable mapping data; therefore, 
most of the contigs on the Y chromosome are unplaced. For more information 
about the assembly process, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/assembly/grc/mouse/" 
TARGET=_blank>NCBI website</A>.</P>
<P>
<B>Notes on the UCSC mm7 version:</B> <BR><BR>
- The UCSC mm7 database contains only the reference strain C57BL/6J.<BR><BR> 
- The Build 35 assembly has a known problem: five contigs were erroneously
placed at the end of chromosome 5 (Mm5_160001_35, Mm5_160002_35, Mm5_160003_35, 
Mm5_160004_35, and Mm5_160005_35). Because the UCSC mm7 data are derived
from Build 35, this problem is also present in the UCSC browser, which 
incorrectly extends the length of chr5 by approximately 3,000,000 bp. NCBI has 
subsequently released Build 35.1, which corrects this problem. Due to the effort
involved, UCSC does not plan to upgrade the mm7 browser to the Build 35.1 
assembly.</P>
<P>
The mm7 sequence and annotation data can be downloaded from the Genome 
Browser <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm7/">FTP server</A> or
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#mouse">Downloads</A> 
web page.
The mm7 annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the

for a detailed list of the organizations and individuals who contributed 
to this release. </P>
