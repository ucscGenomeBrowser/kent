<H2>Description</H2>

<!--#insert file="omimDescriptionText.html"-->

<P>
This track shows the genomic positions of all <B>gene entries</B> in the Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (<A HREF="https://www.omim.org/" TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>) database.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>Genomic locations of OMIM gene entries are displayed as solid blocks.  The entries are colored
according to the associated <b>OMIM phenotype map key</b> (if any):
<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#AAC4AA">Lighter Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 1 OMIM records
-  the disorder has been placed on the map based on its association with
a gene, but the underlying defect is not known.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#669666">Light Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 2 OMIM records
- the disorder has been placed on the map by linkage; no mutation has
been found.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#005000">Dark Green</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 3 OMIM records
- the molecular basis for the disorder is known; a mutation has been
found in the gene.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#69329B">Purple</FONT></B> for phenotype map key 4 OMIM records
- a contiguous gene deletion or duplication syndrome; multiple genes
are deleted or duplicated causing the phenotype.
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#BEBEBE">Light Gray</FONT></B> for Others
- no associated OMIM phenotype map key info available.
</UL>
<P><b>Gene symbol</b>, <b>phenotype</b>, and <b>inheritance</b> information, when available, are 
displayed on the details page for an item, and links to related RefSeq Genes and UCSC Genes are 
given. The descriptions of the OMIM entries are shown on the main browser display when mousing over
each entry.

<P>
<b>Brackets, "[ ]"</b>, before the phenotype name indicate "nondiseases," mainly genetic variations that
lead to apparently abnormal laboratory test values (e.g., dysalbuminemic euthyroidal 
hyperthyroxinemia).
</P>
<P>
<b>Braces, "{ }"</b>, indicate mutations that contribute to susceptibility to multifactorial disorders
(e.g., diabetes, asthma) or to susceptibility to infection (e.g., malaria).
</P>
<P>
<b>Question marks, "?"</b>, indicate that the relationship between the phenotype and gene is provisional.
More details about this relationship are provided in the comment field of the map and in the gene
and phenotype OMIM entries.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mappings displayed in this track are based on OMIM gene entries, their Entrez Gene IDs, and
the corresponding RefSeq Gene locations:
<UL>
<LI>The data file <TT>genemap.txt</TT> from OMIM was loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omimGeneMap</TT>.
<LI>The data file <TT>mim2gene.txt</TT> from OMIM was processed and loaded into the MySQL table <TT>omim2gene</TT>.
<LI>Entries in <TT>genemap.txt</TT> having disorder info were parsed and loaded into the 
<TT>omimPhenotype</TT> table.
<LI>For each OMIM gene in the <TT>omim2gene</TT> table, the
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene" TARGET=_blank>Entrez Gene ID</A> was used to get the
corresponding <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/" target="_blank">RefSeq Gene ID</a> via
the <TT>refLink</TT> table, and the RefSeq ID was used to get the genomic location from the
<TT>refGene</TT> table.* The OMIM gene IDs and corresponding RefSeq Gene locations were loaded into
the <TT>omimGene2</tt> table, the primary table for this track.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
*The locations in the <TT>refGene</TT> table are from alignments of RefSeq Genes to the reference
genome using BLAT.
</P>

<h2>Data Updates</h2>
This track is automatically updated once a week from OMIM data. The most recent update time is shown
at the top of the track documentation page.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
Because OMIM has only allowed Data queries within individual chromosomes, no download files are
available from the Genome Browser. Full genome datasets can be downloaded directly from the
<a href="https://omim.org/downloads/" target="_blank">OMIM Downloads page</a>.
All genome-wide downloads are freely available from OMIM after registration.</p>
<p>
If you need the OMIM data in exactly the format of the UCSC Genome Browser,
for example if you are running a UCSC Genome Browser local installation (a partial &quot;mirror&quot;),
please create a user account on omim.org and contact OMIM via
<a href="https://omim.org/contact" target="_blank">https://omim.org/contact</a>. Send them your OMIM
account name and request access to the UCSC Genome Browser &quot;entitlement&quot;. They will
then grant you access to a MySQL/MariaDB data dump that contains all UCSC
Genome Browser OMIM tables.</p>
<p>
UCSC offers queries within chromosomes from 
<a href="hgTables" target=_blank>Table Browser</a> that include a variety
of filtering options and cross-referencing other datasets using our
<a href="hgIntegrator" target=_blank>Data Integrator</a> tool. 
UCSC also has an <a href="../goldenPath/help/api.html" target=_blank>API</a>
that can be used to retrieve data in JSON format from a particular chromosome range.</p>
<p>
Please refer to our searchable
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!search/download+snps"
target=_blank>mailing list archives</a>
for more questions and example queries, or our
<a HREF="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download36" target=_blank>Data Access FAQ</a>
for more information.</p>

<h4>Example: Retrieve phenotype, Mode of Inheritance, and other OMIM data within a range</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a>, make sure the right dataset is selected:
group: Phenotype and Literature, track: OMIM Genes, table: <tt>omimGene2</tt>.</li>
<li>Define region of interest by entering coordinates or a gene symbol into the &quot;Position&quot; textbox, such as
chr1:11,166,591-11,322,608 or MTOR, or upload a list.</li>
<li>Format your data by setting the &quot;Output format&quot; dropdown to &quot;selected fields from primary 
and related Tables&quot; and click <button>get output</button>. This 
brings up the data field and linked table selection page.</li>
<li>Select chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, and name from <tt>omimGene2</tt> table. Then select the related tables <tt>omim2gene</tt> 
and <tt>omimPhenotype</tt> and click <button>allow selection from check tables</button>.
This brings up the fields of the linked tables, where you can select approvedGeneSymbol,
omimID, description, omimPhenotypeMapKey, and inhMode. </li>
<li>Click on the <button>get output</button> to proceed to the results page:
<pre>chr1	11166591	11322608    601231  Gene: MTOR, Synonyms: FRAP1, SKS, Phenotypes: Smith-Kingsmore syndrome, AD, 3; Focal cortical dysplasia, type II, somatic, 3 </pre></li></ol>
