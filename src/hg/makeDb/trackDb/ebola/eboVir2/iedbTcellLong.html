<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows protein sequences displayed by virus-infected cells to T-cells
as annotated by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
<a href="http://iedb.org" target="_BLANK">Immune Epitope Database</a> (IEDB). 
Only sequences with a positive assay outcome are shown on the track. All fields annotated by
IEDB and exported in their "compact" file are shown on the details page, which also provides links
back to the IEDB.  </p>

<p>
To enrich for MHC Class II epitopes, this track shows only epitopes with more than 12 amino acids.
