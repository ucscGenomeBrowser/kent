<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The transcriptome track shows gene predictions based on data from
RefSeq and EMBL/GenBank. This is a moderately conservative set of
predictions, requiring the support of either one GenBank full length
RNA sequence, one RefSeq RNA, or one spliced EST. The track includes
both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. The CDS are predicted
using <A HREF="http://estscan.sourceforge.net/">ESTScan</A>.</P>
<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>This track in general follows the display conventions for <A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene
prediction tracks</A>. The exons for putative noncoding genes and
untranslated regions are represented by relatively thin blocks, while
those for coding open reading frames are thicker.</P>
<P>This track contains an optional codon coloring feature that allows
users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions. To display
codon colors, select the <EM>genomic codons</EM> option from the
<EM>Color track by codons</EM> pull-down menu. Click <A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">here</A>
for more information about this feature. 
</P>
<P>Further information on the predicted transcripts can be found on
the <A HREF="http://www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/tromer/">Transcriptome Web
interface</A>.</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The transcriptome is built using a multi-step pipeline: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RefSeq and GenBank RNAs and ESTs
	are aligned to the genome with <A HREF="http://sibsim4.sourceforge.net/">SIBsim4</A>,
	keeping only the best alignments for each RNA. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alignments are broken up at
	non-intronic gaps, with small isolated fragments thrown out. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A splicing graph is created for
	each set of overlapping alignments. This graph has an edge for each
	exon or intron, and a vertex for each splice site, start, and end.
	Each RNA that contributes to an edge is kept as evidence for that
	edge. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The graph is traversed to generate
	all unique transcripts. The traversal is guided by the initial RNAs
	to avoid a combinatorial explosion in alternative splicing. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Protein predictions are generated. 
	</P>
</OL>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>The transcriptome track was produced on the <A HREF="http://www.vital-it.ch/">Vital-IT</A>
high-performance computing platform using a computational pipeline
developed by Christian Iseli with help from colleagues at the <A HREF="http://www.licr.org/">Ludwig
institute for Cancer Research</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.isb-sib.ch/">Swiss
Institute of Bioinformatics</A>. It is based on data from NCBI <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/" TARGET="_blank">RefSeq</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html" TARGET="_blank">GenBank</A>/<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/">EMBL</A>.
Our thanks to the people running these databases and to the
scientists worldwide who have made contributions to them.
