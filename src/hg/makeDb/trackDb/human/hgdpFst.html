<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
In this track, the value shown for each SNP is -log<sub>10</sub> of the
fraction of SNPs with a more extreme F<sub>ST</sub> value than that SNP.


Relative F<sub>ST</sub> 
(also known as the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_index"
TARGET=_BLANK>Fixation index</A>) values were calculated
from SNPs genotyped in 53 populations worldwide by the 
<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/morrinst/hgdp.html" TARGET=_BLANK>Human 
Genome Diversity Project</A> in collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://www.cephb.fr/en/cephdb/" TARGET=_BLANK>Centre d'Etude 
du Polymorphisme Humain</A> (HGDP-CEPH).
This track and several others are available from the 
<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>HGDP Selection Browser</A>.

From <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_index"
TARGET=_BLANK>Wikipedia</A>:
<blockquote>
Fixation index (F<sub>ST</sub>) is a measure of population differentiation based
on genetic polymorphism data, such as Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) or microsatellites. It is a special case of 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-statistics"
TARGET=_BLANK>F-statistics</A>, the
concept developed in the 1920s by Sewall Wright.  This statistic
compares the genetic variability within and between populations and is
frequently used in the field of population genetics.

TARGET=_BLANK>http://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/popecol/Maylects/PopGenGloss.html</A>:
<blockquote>
F<sub>ST</sub> is the proportion of the total genetic variance
contained in a subpopulation (the S subscript) relative to the total
genetic variance (the T subscript). Values can range from 0 to 1. High
F<sub>ST</sub> implies a considerable degree of differentiation among
populations.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Samples collected by the HGDP-CEPH from 1,043 individuals from around the
world were genotyped for 657,000 SNPs at
<A HREF="http://hagsc.org/hgdp/" TARGET=_BLANK>Stanford</A>.
The 53 populations were divided into seven continental groups: Africa,
Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
F<sub>ST</sub> was computed for all SNPs, and then each SNP's place in 
the empirical F<sub>ST</sub> distribution was used to derive the scores 
shown in this track, -log<sub>10</sub> of the fraction of SNPs with a 
more extreme F<sub>ST</sub> value than that SNP.
