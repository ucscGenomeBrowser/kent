<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows locations of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
detected primarily by looking at overlaps between clones that
cover the same region of the genome.  </P>

<P>Thanks to the <A HREF="http://snp.cshl.org/" TARGET=_blank>SNP
Consortium</A> and NIH's <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP

<H2>Filtering of dbSNP data for UCSC SNP tracks.</H2>

<P>The SNPs in this track include all of the polymorphisms that can be
mapped against the current assembly.  This includes known point
mutations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), insertions, deletions,
and segmental mutations from the current build of dbSNP.  There are
three major cases that are not mapped and/or annotated:</P>

<P>a. Submissions that are completely masked as repetitive
elements. These are dropped from any further computations. This set of
refSNPs are dumped in chromosome "rs_chMasked" on the dbSNP ftp site.</P>

<P>b. Submissions that are defined in a cDNA context with extensive
splicing. These SNPs are typically annotated on refseq mRNAs through a
separate annotation process. Effort is being made to reverse map these
variations back to contig coordinates, but that has not been
implemented. For now, you can find this set of variations in
"rs_chNotOn" on the dbSNP ftp site.</P>

<P>c. Submissions with excessive hits to the genome. Variations with
3+ hits to the genome are not included in the tracks, but are available in
"rs_chMulti" on the dbSNP ftp site.</P>

<P>The heuristics for the non-SNP variations (i.e. named elements and
STRs) are quite conservative so some of these are probably lost. This
approach was chosen to avoid false annotation of variation in
inappropriate locations.</P>

<P>The dbSNP ftp site can be found at <A
