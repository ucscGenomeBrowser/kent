<H2> Description </H2>

<P>This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription 
factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). 
Each experiment is associated with an input signal, which represents the 
control condition where immunoprecipitation with non-specific immunoglobulin 
was performed in the same cell type. For each experiment (cell type vs. 
antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for TF binding (<I>Signal</I>),
along with sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor 
binding, as identified by the PeakSeq algorithm (<I>Peaks</I>).
<P>
The sequence reads, quality scores, and alignment coordinates from
these experiments are available for download.
</P>


<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>).  For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
ENCODE tracks typically contain one or more of the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD> Regions of signal enrichment based on processed data
(usually normalized data from pooled replicates). Intensity is represented in 
grayscale, the darker shading shows higher intensity (a solid vertical line
in the peak region represents the the point with the highest signal).
ENCODE Peaks tables contain fields for statistical significance, including FDR
(<A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/qValue.html" TARGET=_BLANK>qValue</A>).</DD>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on
processed data.</DD>
</DL>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
For details on the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used, 
see Euskirchen <EM>et. al.</EM>, (2007), Rozowsky <EM>et. al.</EM> (2009) 
and Auerbach <EM>et. al.</EM> (2009).

DNA recovered from the precipitated chromatin was sequenced on the Illumina (Solexa)
sequencing platform and mapped to the genome using the Eland alignment program.
ChIP-seq data was scored based on sequence reads (length ~30 bps) that align uniquely
to the human genome. From the mapped tags, a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments
(average fragment length ~ 200 bp) was constructed where the signal height is the number of
overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome. Reads were pooled from 
all submitted replicates to generate the Peak and Signal files. Per-replicate
aligments and sequences are available for download at
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/wgEncodeSydhTfbs/"
 TARGET=_BLANK>downloads page</A>.
</P>
<P>
For each 1 Mb segment of each chromosome, a peak height threshold was determined
by requiring a false discovery rate &le; 0.01 when comparing the number of peaks
above threshold as compared to the number obtained from multiple simulations of a
random null background with the same number of mapped reads (also accounting 
for the fraction of mapable bases for sequence tags in that 1 Mb segment). The
number of mapped tags in a putative binding region is compared to the normalized
(normalized by correlating tag counts in genomic 10 kb windows) number of 
mapped tags in the same region from an input DNA control. Using a binomial test,
only regions that have a p-value &le; 0.01 are considered to be significantly 
enriched compared to the input DNA control.
