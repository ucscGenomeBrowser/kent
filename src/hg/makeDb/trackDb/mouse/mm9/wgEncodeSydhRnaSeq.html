<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
The tracks show enrichment of RNA sequence tags generated by
high throughput sequencing (RNA Seq) and mapped to the human
genome. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized either from
polyadenylated RNA (polyA+) or, in order to analyze transcription
from RNA polymerase III, from RNA remaining after depletion of
both ribosomal RNA and polyadenylated RNA (polyA-/rRNA-). 
PCR amplified, adapter ligated cDNA, 150-300nt
long, was sequenced on an Illumina GA sequencer.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>
This track contains alignment views with multiple subtracks that display individually on the browser:
<DL>
<DT><i>Alignments</i>
</DT><DD>The Alignments view shows reads mapped to the genome and indicates where
bases may mismatch.  The alignment file follows the standard SAM format of Bowtie output.  See the <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#sam-bowtie-output" target=_blank>Bowtie Manual</a> for more information about the SAM Bowtie output and the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf#page=4" target=_blank>SAM Format Specification</a> for more information on the SAM/BAM file format.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" target="_blank">ENCODE cell culture protocols</a>.

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents
(15596-018, Life Tech), following the manufacturer's protocol.
For polyA+ samples, polyadenylated RNA was purified using the
MicroPoly(A) Purist kit (AM1919, Life Tech) and fragmented using
RNA Fragmentation Reagent (AM8740, Life Tech). Illumina adapters
were ligated to double stranded cDNA which was synthesized using
reagents from Life Tech (11917-010).
For polyA-/rRNA- samples, ribosomal
RNA was removed from total RNA using the RiboMinus Eukaryote
Kit (K1550-02, Life Tech) and polyadenylated RNA was purified
away from the rRNA depleted fraction using the MicroPoly(A) Purist
kit (AM1919, Life Tech). Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was
performed on the rRNA/polyA depleted RNA using random primers
and the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (11917-010,
Life Tech).
</P>
<P>
PCR amplified adapter ligated cDNA (150-300 bp) was sequenced
using Illumina GA. Sequence reads of 27-33nt long with 0-2
mismatches were mapped to the mouse genome (version mm9) using
the BWA aligner, version 0.5.7. The signal height
corresponds to the number of overlapping fragments at each
nucleotide position in the genome. 
</P>

<!-----From the mapped tags, a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments was constructed where 
the signal height is the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide 
position in the genome.
