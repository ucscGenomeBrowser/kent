<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays blastz and untranslated blat alignments of the 
13 Nov. 2003 chimpanzee draft assembly to the human genome. The alignments 
are filtered to display only the best alignment for any given region of the 
human genome.  The track shows a graph of the score of the alignment.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were generated by blastz on repeatmasked sequence using 
the following human/chimp scoring matrix: 
<PRE>
     A    C    G    T
A   100 -300 -150 -300
C  -300  100 -300 -150
G  -150 -300  100 -300
T  -300 -150 -300  100

K = 4500, L = 3000,  Y=3400, H=2000
</PRE></P>
<P>
Following blastz, a DNA blat of unmasked sequence was done to 
place additional scaffolds. Both alignments were processed by the
axtChain program, and both chains were merged to create
a set of &quot;all chains&quot;, as described on the Chimp Chain track 
description page The chains were then processed with the programs chainNet 
and netChainSubset to create a reciprocal best alignment net, as described 
on the Chimp Net track description page. Finally, single-coverage alignments 
were extracted from the chimp alignment net using the netToAxt program.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the display mode,
turn on the chromosome color track, or filter the display output by
chromosome. The filter is located at the top of the track description page,
which is accessed via the small button to the left of the track's graphical
display or through the link on the track's control menu.
<UL>
<LI><B>Color track</B>: To display the chromosome color track, click the
<em>on</em> button next to &quot;Color track based on chromosome&quot;.
When the color track is activated, each of the items within the annotation
track will be colored to show the chromosome in the aligning genome
assembly from which the alignment originated.
<LI><B>Chromosome filter</B>: To display only alignments from a specific
chromomsome in the aligning assembly, type the chromosome number (in the
form <I>chrN</I>) in the text box to the right of &quot;Filter by
chromosome&quot;. For example, to display alignments from chromosome 6,
type &quot;chr6&quot;.
</UL><P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <I>Submit</I>
button.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2> 
<P>
The chimp sequence used in this track was obtained from the 13 Nov. 2003 
Arachne assembly. We'd like to thank the National Human Genome Research 
Institute (NHGRI), the Broad Institute, and Washington University St. Louis
School of Medicine for providing this sequence.</P>
