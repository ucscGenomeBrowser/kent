<P>
This track shows the contigs used to assemble the supercontigs
in the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  
</P>
<P>
The assembly is 9.5X WGS coverage. The 3,510 supercontigs are displayed
in the UCSC Genome browser as a single artifical chromosome chrUn with an
artifical gap of 1,000 N's between supercontigs. The largest supercontig
is 4,147,112 bp with 121 supercontigs larger than 377,562 bp (N50) containing
over %50 of the sequence.
