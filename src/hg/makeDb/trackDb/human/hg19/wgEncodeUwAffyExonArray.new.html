<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays human tissue microarray data using
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/browse/products.jsp?productId=131452&navMode=34000&navAction=jump&aId=productsNav#1_1" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0</A> GeneChip
and was produced as part of the ENCODE Project. This track in the hg19 assembly is a continuation of
the work displayed in the hg18 assembly with additional cell lines added.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The display for this track shows probe location and signal value
as grayscale-colored items where higher
signal values correspond to darker-colored blocks.  Items with score of 1000
are in the highest 10% quantile for signal value of that particular cell type.
Similarly, items scoring 900 are the next 10% quantile and at the bottom of
scale, items scoring 100 are in the lowest 10% quantile for signal value.
</P>
<P>The subtracks within this composite annotation track correspond to data from 
different cell types and tissues.  The configuration options are 
shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of 
subtracks. 
To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you 
wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
A subset of the cells were stored frozen in RNALater. For the WI-38 Tamoxifen-treated
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/otherTerms.html#treatment" TARGET=_BLANK>(4OHTAM_20nM_72hr)</A>
cell type, cells at 50-80% confluency were treated for 72 hours with 20 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen in growth medium 
(from a 1000X working stock in absolute ethanol). At harvest, greater than 95% of DNA synthesis was inhibited and the cells had 
an induced fusiform/round morphology with greater than 95% showing dramatic senescence-associated heterochromatic foci.
Total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST V2 arrays using hg19 probesets.  Exon and gene level
expression analysis were carried out using Affymetrix ExACT 1.2.1 and Affymetrix
Expression Console 1.1 software tools. Samples were quantile normalized for
background correction and Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error summarized.

<H2>Verification</H2>

Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying correlation
coefficient >0.9.
