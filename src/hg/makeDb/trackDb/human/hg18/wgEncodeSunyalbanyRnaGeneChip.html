<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows expression of
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=ripTgtProtein">
target RNA binding proteins (RBPs)</A>
as measured by RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray profiling
(RIP-chip) using different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=ripAntibody">
RIP antibodies</A>
in multiple 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>.
The <i>RBP Assoc RNA</i> view shows the genomic location of transcripts 
associated with the array probes.  
Data for this track was produced as part of the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>,

<P>In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional 
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive 
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However, 
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in 
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns. 
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the 
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Chip profiling.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>This track is a multi-view composite track. For each view there
are multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines.
This track is initially released with a single view:

<DL>
<DT><i>RBP Assoc RNA</i>
<DD>The RBP Assoc RNA view shows the genomic extent of the transcripts 
associated with 
the Affymetrix Exon Array probes, shaded according to score.

Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are 
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to the approved
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell">ENCODE cell culture protocols </A>.
The associated messages were identified using Affymetrix 
Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays. 
Measurements of expression at gene-level were extracted using 
Affymetrix tools, and were further processed 
to generate average fold-change and p-values for immunoprecipitation.
Enriched regions were scored in the range ~100 to ~1000, and interrogated
regions without significant signal were scored at 1.
The signal value contains the minimum log2 fold-change, the p-value
contains -log10 of the maximum p-value, and the q-value was
left at the default of -1.
