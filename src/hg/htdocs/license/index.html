<h1>Website: No license or permission is needed to use the website, API and public MySQL server for academic, commercial or any other use</h1>
<p>This is a public website. There is no license or permission needed to use
the website and any services (API, etc) on it. You can also load your own data onto our
website and look at it there, and use track hubs or custom tracks to configure
how it is displayed, as a commercial, non-commercial or any other entity. However, 
when you use the UCSC Genome Browser in your work, please cite one of our
<a href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Graphics: No permission is needed to reproduce a graphic produced by the Genome Browser</h1>
<p>Permission is granted for reuse of all graphics produced
by the UCSC Genome Browser website. There is no need to contact us to get permission. If your 
publisher, notably Elsevier, insists on getting approval, please direct them to this webpage. 
However, when you use the UCSC Genome Browser in your work, please cite one of our 
<a href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.</p>
<br>

<h1>Data: No license is needed for the data files and database tables used by the Genome Browser</h1>
<p>
As far as the UCSC Genome Browser group is concerned, the raw table data and binary
files used to create the graphics by the browser is freely available for both
public and commercial use. This applies to data that is downloaded as files via 
http, https, ftp or rsync, and equally when data is accessed through 
the public MySQL server or via the web API. The only exception are the liftOver chain files,
they can be linked, downloaded, used and redistributed, but only for non-commercial use
see the <a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/liftOver/">liftOver README</a>.

</p>
<p>Sometimes, the source databases or authors place restrictions on data. In very rare
cases, the genomes come with citation requirements. The README.txt file in the
download directory of each assembly shows the
original restrictions pertaining to the genome
sequence itself by the original authors; most assemblies do not have any restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Certain genome annotation data, mostly on the human
genome and in the domain of clinical genetics, have specific restrictions.
For some of these, we are not allowed to make the data available. 
Usually the data must be obtained from the source database directly in the
original format or licensed, rather from UCSC. Examples are HGMD, LOVD, OMIM, Decipher,
Genomenon, Genehancer and COSMIC. For viral genomes, any GISAID-sequences or any data
derived from GISAID sequences cannot be shared by us. Please see the respective
track documentation pages on these assemblies for more details, by selecting
the assembly and clicking the track title in the genome browser. They usually
list or link to the exact license conditions. Files for these tracks are not
available from our download servers, please contact us for questions or if you
need a pointer to the respective conversion scripts in our Github code
repository.</p><br>

<h1 id="free">Software: Most command-line tools and directories are freely available for all uses</h1>
<p>
The majority of the Genome Browser source code is available under the
MIT license, see 
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/LICENSE" 
target=_blank>the LICENSE file in our source code repository</a>. As such, the 
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">
Unix command line utilities</a> needed to build 
tracks, track hub files, computational pipelines, and our
hundreds of tools to filter, sort, rearrange, join, and process genome
annotation files can be used and redistributed freely 
via package managers and installation tools, even for commercial use (except BLAT/LiftOver).  
Notable examples are bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig, overlapSelect, featureBits,
pslMap, pslFilter and pslCDnaFilter.  </p>

<p>
The exceptions are source code directories with special LICENSE files in them. 
These are <code>kent/src/blat</code>, <code>kent/src/isPcr</code>, <code>kent/src/jkOwnLib</code>, and 
the programs that produce the graphical images or user interface
for the UCSC Genome Browser. This includes the following subdirectories under 
<code>kent/src/hg</code>:
</p>

<p><code>cgilib hgApi hgCollection hgFileSearch hgFileUi hgGateway hgGene 
hgGenome hgIntegrator hgPal hgPcr hgPhyloPlace hgPublicSessions hgSession hgSuggest 
hgTables hgTrackUi hgTracks hgVai hgc hubApi near visiGene liftOver</code>
</p>

<p>
See the LICENSE file in the top level of our source code for a listing of
licenses and directories that they apply to: 
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/LICENSE">
https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/LICENSE</a>.
Directories under non-commercial licenses have LICENSE files in them that start
with the "LicenseRef-proprietary" SPDX tag.  </p>

<p>When you use the UCSC Genome Browser in your work, please cite one of 
our <a href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.</p>
<br>

<h1>Software: Download and installation of the graphical Genome Browser software 
and access to the source code is free for non-commercial uses but not commercial usage</h1>
<p>Non-commercial usage for the Genome Browser graphical interface (primarily the "hgTracks" program),
including download and local installation, aka setting up a 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/mirror.html">"mirror"</a>, is free. When you use the UCSC
Genome Browser in your work, please cite one of our <a
    href="../goldenPath/pubs.html">publications</a>.
</p>

<p>
For commercial use, a license is required for download and local installation of
certain Genome Browser webserver CGI binaries and source code. In the source
code repository, the respective directories are marked by special LICENSE
files in them. As specified above, this applies to <code>kent/src/blat</code>, 
<code>kent/src/isPcr</code>, 
<code>kent/src/jkOwnLib</code>, and the following subdirectories and 
programs under <code>kent/src/hg</code>. The majority of license protected files 
are the programs that produce the graphical images and the graphical user interface 
for the UCSC Genome Browser:</p>
<br>

<p><code>cgilib hgApi hgCollection hgFileSearch hgFileUi hgGateway hgGene hgGenome 
hgIntegrator hgPal hgPcr hgPhyloPlace hgPublicSessions hgSession hgSuggest hgTables hgTrackUi 
hgTracks hgVai hgc hubApi near visiGene liftOver</code>
</p>

<p>
Also, BLAT and isPCR, if needed, are covered by a separate license (see below). This concerns 
the source code directories <code>kent/src/blat</code>, <code>kent/src/isPcr</code> 
and <code>kent/src/jkOwnLib</code>.
</p>

<p>
To purchase a commercial license for Genome Browser source code, LiftOver, GBiB, or GBiC, please 
visit the <a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu">Genome Browser store</a>. </p>

<p>
We also have an <a href="../FAQ/FAQlicense.html">FAQ on licensing questions</a>
which may help to clarify questions on how to license the code. We also have documentation 
on how to choose the best option for a local installation of a 
<a target=_blank href="../goldenPath/help/mirror.html">Genome Browser "mirror"</a>.
</p>
