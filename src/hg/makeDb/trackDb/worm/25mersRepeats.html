<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Marking the repetetive 25mers in WS170. The centers of repeated 25mers
are marked black and areas that are covered by the 25mers are in grey.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A sliding window of 25 bases was passed over the genome.  Each base
in the genome is the start of a 25 bp window.  The number of occurrences
of each of the 25mers is tabulated.  Any 25mer that occurs more than
once is colored grey over its 25bp extent, and the center base is marked
in black.  Thus, runs of consecutive black bases indicate overlapping
25mers with their centers adjacent.
