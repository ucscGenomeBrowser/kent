<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays DNaseI-hypersensitive sites in CD4+ T-cells
before and after activation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.  
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites are
associated with gene regulatory regions, particularly for upregulated
genes.  CD4+ T-cells, also known as helper or inducer T cells, are
involved in generating an immune response.  CD4+ T-cells are also
one of the primary targets of the HIV virus.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The top subtrack of this annotation corresponds to unactivated T cells; the 
bottom subtrack shows activated T cells. Within the subtracks, the gray and 
black blocks (which appear as vertical lines when the display is zoomed-out) 
represent probable hypersensitive sites. The darker the blocks, the 
more likely the site is to be hypersensitive.</P>
<P>
To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you 
wish to hide. The display may also be filtered to show only those items
with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a
threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the 
description page.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Primary human CD4+ T cells were activated by incubation with anti-CD3 and 
anti-CD28 antibodies for 24 hours.
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites were cloned from the cells 
before and after activation, and
sequenced using massively parallel signature sequencing 
(Brenner <em>et al</em>., 2000; Crawford <em>et al</em>., 2006). 
Only those clusters of multiple DNaseI library sequences that map within 500 
bases of each other are displayed.
Each cluster has a unique identifier, visible when the track is displayed
in full or packed mode. The last digit of each identifier represents the 
number of sequences that map within that particular cluster. The sequence number
is also reflected in the score, <em>e.g.</em> a cluster of two sequences scores 
500, three sequences scores 750 and four or more sequences scores 1000.  </P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Real-time PCR assay was used to verify valid
DNaseI-hypersensitive sites.  Approximately 50% of
clusters of two sequences are valid.  These clusters are shown
in light gray. 80% of clusters of three sequences are valid, indicated by
dark gray. 100% of clusters of four or more
sequences are valid, shown in black.</P>
<P>
This data set includes confirmed elements for 35 of the 44
ENCODE regions.
It is estimated that these data identify
10-20% of all hypersensitive sites within CD4+ T cells. Further
sequencing will be required to identify additional sites.</P>
