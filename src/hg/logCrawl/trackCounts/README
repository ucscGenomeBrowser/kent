This directory is for tallying track counts given a specific date range.

The runCountByDate.sh relies upon pre-trimmed apache logs, and tallies up
track counts. It should be run as a cronjob, for example:
43 9 * * tue /path/to/runCountByDate.sh -c 2>/path/to/save/cron.stderr

The trimmed logs are controlled by the scripts in ../trimLogs, and ran by qateam.

The makeUsageReport script is meant to be run manually and can give you track
or database usage counts over a specific time period. Run with no options for
a help message.
