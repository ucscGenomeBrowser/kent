<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the draft assembly (Dec. 2011, International Painted Turtle
Genome Sequencing Consortium (GCA_000241765.1)) of the $organism genome.
Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs and when possible,
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence.
</p>

<p>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the currently viewed
scaffold. Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and
brown coloration. Where gaps exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the
gold and brown blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold are always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.
</p>

<p>
All components within this track, with the exception of the mitochondrial sequence
(chrM - NC_002073), are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;: Whole Genome Shotgun contig.
