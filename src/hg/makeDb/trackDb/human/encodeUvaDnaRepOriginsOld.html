<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved 
isolation of replication products from HeLa cells synchronized 
at the G1-S boundary by thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells 
released from the block were labeled with BrdU at every two-hour 
interval of the 10 hours of S-phase and DNA was isolated from them. 
The heavy-light (H/L) DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated 
during each two-hour labeling period was separated from the unlabeled 
DNA by double cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The 
purified H/L DNA was then hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within 
the ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The time of replication of 50% (TR<SUB>50</SUB>) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the five time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classed as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether or not at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point.</P>
<P>
The TR<SUB>50</SUB> data for the temporally specific probes were then smoothed
within a 95 kb window using lowess smoothing.  This smoothing was done
for three replicates (two biological and one technical) and for the
average of the three replicates.  Local minima were identified on the
smoothed TR<SUB>50</SUB> profiles to locate possible origins of replication.
The predictions were taken from the average of the replicates and then
given a width of 200 bp for display in the browser.  The confidence
intervals were identified as consensus sites among the three replicates
with endpoints taken on the outlying replicates for each consensus site.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets and
a technical replicate in the HeLa adherent cell line.</P>

DNA replication group in the Dutta Lab at the University of 
Virginia: Neerja Karnani, Christopher Taylor, Hakkyun Kim,
Louis Lim, Ankit Malhotra, Gabe Robins and Anindya Dutta.</P>
