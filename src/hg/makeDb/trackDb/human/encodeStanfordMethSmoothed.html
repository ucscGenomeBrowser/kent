<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays smoothed (sliding-window mean) scores for 
experimentally determined regions of unmethylated
CpGs in the ENCODE regions.  These experiments were performed in eight
cell lines, each of which is displayed as a separate subtrack:

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
High molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from each cell line.
The genomic DNA was digested with a cocktail of six methyl-sensitive
restriction enzymes (AciI, HhaI, BstUI, HpaII, HgaI, and HpyCH4IV) and
size selected to deplete the genome of unmethylated regions.  Digested
and undigested DNA (control) were amplified, labeled, and hybridized
to oligo tiling arrays produced by NimbleGen.  The data for each array
were median subtracted (log 2 ratios) and normalized (divided by the 
standard deviation).</P>
<P>
The transformed mean ratios of undigested:digested genomic DNA for 
all probes were then smoothed by calculating a sliding-window mean.  
Windows of six neighboring probes (sliding two probes at a time) were 
used; within each window, the highest and lowest value were dropped, 
and the remaining four values were averaged.  In order to increase the 
contrast between high and low values for visual display, the average 
was converted to a score by the formula: <BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
score = 8^(average) * 10<BR> </TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
These scores are for visualization purposes; for all analyses, 
the raw ratios, which are available in the Stanf Meth track, should be used.  
</P>
<P>
Higher scores in this track indicate regions that are more strongly
methylated, due to the greater difference between the undigested and
digested hybridization signals.
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were done for
each of the eight cell lines.  
The Myers lab is currently testing the specificity and sensitivity using 
real-time PCR. </P>
