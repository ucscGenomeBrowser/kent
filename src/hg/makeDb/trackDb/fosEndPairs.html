<H2>Description</H2>
<P>A valid pair of fosmid end sequences must be
at least 30 kb but no more than 50 kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first fosmid end sequence must be &quot;+&quot; and
the orientation of the second fosmid end sequence must be &quot;-&quot;.</P>

<P><strong>Note:</strong> For hg19 and hg18 assemblies, the Fosmid 
End Pairs track is a main track under the &quot;Mapping and 
Sequencing&quot; track category.</P>

<P>On the hg38 assembly, the FOSMID End Pairs track is a subtrack 
within the Clone Ends track under the &quot;Mapping and 
Sequencing&quot; track category. Under the list of subtracks on the 
Clone Ends Track Settings page, the FOSMID End Pairs track is now named 
&quot;WIBR-2 Fosmid library.&quot; With the 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&cloneEndSuper=full&cloneEndWI2_sel=1"
TARGET=_blank>WIBR-2 Fosmid library track
setting on full,</a> individual clone end mapping items are
listed in the browser; click into any item to see details from NCBI. 

<H2>Methods</H2> <P> End sequences were trimmed at the NCBI using
ssahaCLIP written by Jim Mullikin.  Trimmed fosmid end sequences were
placed on the assembled sequence using Jim Kent's 
<A HREF="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/4/656.abstract" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
program. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P> Sequencing of the fosmid ends was done at the 
<A HREF="https://www.broadinstitute.org/" TARGET=_blank>Eli & Edythe L. Broad
Institute</A> of MIT and Harvard University.  Clones are available through the
<A HREF="http://bacpacresources.org/" TARGET=_blank>BACPAC Resources
Center</A> at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI).
