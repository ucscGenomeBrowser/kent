<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. </P>
<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap.</P>
<P>
This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps between clones in the same map contig.  These
may be bridged or not.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - non-bridged gaps between map contigs.
<LI><B>Centromere</B> - non-bridged gaps from centromeres.
<LI><B>Telomere</B> - non-bridged gaps from telomeres.
<LI><B>Heterochromatin</B> - non-bridged gaps from large blocks of heterochromatin.
<LI><B>Short Arm</B> - non-bridged long gaps on the short arm of the chromosome.
