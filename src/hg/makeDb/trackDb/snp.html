<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
  This track consolidates all the Simple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) into
  a single track.  This represents data from dbSnp and commercially-available 
  genotyping arrays.
</P>
<P>
  Please be aware that some mapping inconsistencies are known to exist in 
  the dbSnp data set. If you encounter information that seems incorrect on 
  the details page for a variant, we advise you to verify the record information
  on the dbSnp website using the provided link. In some
  known instances, the size of the variant does not match the size of its 
  genomic location; UCSC is working with dbSnp to correct these errors in
  the data set. 
</P>
<H2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</H2>
<P>
  Variants are shown as single tick marks at most zoom levels.
  When viewing the track at or near base-level resolution, the displayed
  width of the SNP corresponds to the width of the variant in the reference
  sequence. Insertions are indicated by a single tick mark displayed between
  two nucleotides, single nucleotide polymorphisms are displayed as the width 
  of a single base, and multiple nucleotide variants are represented by a 
  block that spans two or more bases.
</P>
<P>
  When the start coordinate for a SNP is shown as chromStart = chromEnd+1 on 
  the SNP's details page, this is generally not an 
  error; rather, it indicates that the variant is an insertion at this genomic
  position.  In these instances, the location type will be set to 
  &quot;between&quot;. Note that insertions are represented as chromStart = 
  chromEnd in the <em>snp</em> table accessible from the Table Browser 
  or downloads server, due to the half-open zero-based representation of
  data in the underlying database. 
</P>
<P>
  The colors of variants in the display may be changed to highlight
  their source, molecule type, variant class, validation status, or
  functional classification. Variants can be excluded from the display
  based on these same criteria or if they fall below the
  user-specified minimum <A name="AvHet"></A>
  <A
  HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/Hetfreq.html" target="_blank">
  average heterozygosity</A>. The track configuration options are
  located at the top of the <A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=snp"> SNPs track
  description page</A>.  By default variants are colored by functional
  classification, with SNPs likely to cause a phenotype in red
  (non-synonymous and splice site mutations).

<H2>Large Scale SNP Annotation at UCSF</H2>
<P>
  LS-SNP is a database of functional and structural SNP annotations
  with links to protein structure models.  Annotations are based on a
  variety of features extracted from protein structure, sequence, and
  evolution.  Currently only coding non-synonomous SNPs are included.
  <A HREF="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/" target=_BLANK>LS-SNP at UCSF</A>.
</P>

<H2>Data Filtering</H2>
<P>
  The SNPs in this track include all known polymorphisms available in the
  current build of <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/"
  TARGET=_blank>dbSnp</A> that can be mapped against the current assembly. 
  The version of dbSnp from which these data were obtained can be found in the
  SNP track entry in the Genome Browser 
  <A HREF="/goldenPath/releaseLog.html">release log</A>.
</P>
<P>
  There are two reasons that some variants may not be mapped and/or
  annotated in this track:
  <UL>
    <LI> 
      Submissions are completely masked as repetitive elements.
      These are dropped from any further computations. This set of
      reference SNPs is found in chromosome &quot;rs_chMasked&quot; on
      the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP
      ftp site</A>.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Submissions are defined in a cDNA context with extensive
      splicing. These SNPs are typically annotated on refSeq mRNAs
      through a separate annotation process. Effort is being made to
      reverse map these variations back to contig coordinates, but
      that has not been implemented. For now, you can find this set of
      variations in &quot;rs_chNotOn&quot; on the <A
      HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/" TARGET=_blank>dbSNP ftp
      site</A>.  
    </LI>
  </UL>
</P>
<P>
  The heuristics for the non-SNP variations (i.e. named elements and
  short tandem repeats (STRs)) are quite conservative; therefore, some of 
  these are probably lost. This approach was chosen to avoid false 
  annotation of variation in inappropriate locations.
