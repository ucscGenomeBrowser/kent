This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the hgN MySQL database.

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by 
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.   

There may be subdirectories for each organism such
as 'mouse', and underneath these directories for
each database, such as 'hg7'.  There are a trackDb.ra 
file and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Tracks descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in the parent directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

After editing a track definition here
don't forget to run hgTrackDb to bring
it into the MySQL database.  To update
your personal copy (on hgwdev-userName) do
    make update
to do it on genome-test do
    make alpha

Most of the fields in the track.ra file should 
be reasonably self explanitory.  A notable exception
is the type field.  Currently there are six types:
bed, psl, and genePred.  Here is the format of these
type fields:
For bed types it's always three words as follows:
   1) bed (always)
   2) fieldCount - the number of standard fields
   3) extraInfo - either '.' meaning no non-standard fields
       or '+' if there are additional non-standard fields.
For psl types it's
   1) psl
   2) subtype, which is either
        .  (just regular human mRNA)
        est    (human displays a little differently in dense mode)
        xeno (cross species)
   3) Optional extra parameter for xeno subtype: database associated
      with other organism.  If present the display can be colored by
      chromosome and the chromosome and position in kilobases is shown
      as the item label.
For gene predictions 
    1) genePred
    2) (optional) associated protein sequence table
    3) (optional) associated mRNA table.
For chains it's
    1) chain
    2) database for other organism 
For nets it's
    1) chain
    2) database for other organism
    3) associated chain track
For sample
    1) sample
    2) minVal (optional, default 0).  Used just for label.
    3) maxVal (optional, default 1000).  Used just for label.
    4) scale - what to scale samples that
       min and max values in database end up
       0 and 1.
    2) number of fields (currently always 9)

If something lacks a type field it needs to have custom
display routines.   You can remove a track from the
browser by removing it from the .ra file and doing
a make update.

The shortLabel and longLabel fields may have the following
variables, which will be substituted:
     $ORGANISM - all upper case organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $Organism - initial capped organism, like 'Mouse'
     $organism - all lower case organism, like 'mouse'
     $db - database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $date - freeze date of underlying assembly
     $blurb - If there is a blurb field in the .ra file this echos it.
In addition if there is a $otherDb field set in the .ra file these
variables are available
     $o_ORGANISM - all upper case other organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $o_Organism - initial capped other organism, like 'Mouse'
     $o_organism - all lower case other organism, like 'mouse'
     $o_db - other database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $o_date - freeze date of underlying other assembly
