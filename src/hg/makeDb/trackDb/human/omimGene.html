<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a set of UCSC canonical genes that 
might be referenced by the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim"
TARGET=_blank>OMIM</A>)
database, based on cross-reference information from RefSeq and UniProt.
</P>

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text, 
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known mendelian 
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the 
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University 
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database 
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog 
of mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM). 
</P> 

<P><B>NOTE</B>: OMIM is intended for use primarily by physicians and other
professionals concerned with genetic disorders, by genetics researchers, and
by advanced students in science and medicine. While the OMIM database is
open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
This annotation was constructed as follows: 
<UL>
<LI>A set of UCSC genes with cross-references to RefSeq genes with associated
OMIM IDs, as defined in the Genome Browser database <TT>refLink</TT> table,
was compiled.
<LI>A second set of UCSC genes was compiled in which the corresponding
UniProt proteins had external links to OMIM, based on data in the <TT>spXref2</TT>
table in the UCSC proteome database.
<LI>The two gene sets were combined and duplicates removed, resulting in a subset of
UCSC genes that have associated OMIM IDs.
<LI>Each of the genes in the combined set was replaced with its associated
canonical gene, based on data from the UCSC canonical gene set defined by
the <TT>knownIsoforms</TT> and <TT>knownCanonical</TT> tables.
<LI>Duplicates were removed from the canonical set, and the data were
sorted and loaded into the <TT>omimGene</TT> table.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, data from the OMIM <TT>genemap</TT> file were loaded into the
<TT>omimGeneMap</TT> table in the Genome Browser database. Descriptive
information from this table is displayed on the OMIM Related Genes details
pages.
