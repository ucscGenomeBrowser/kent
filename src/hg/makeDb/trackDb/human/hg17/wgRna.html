<H2>Description</H2>
This track displays positions of three different types of RNA in the human 
genome: 
microRNAs from the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/" TARGET=_blank>
miRNA Registry</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A> and C/D box and H/ACA 
small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) from the snoRNA-LBME-DB maintained at the 
<A HREF="http://www-lbme.biotoul.fr/" TARGET=_blank>Laboratoire de Biologie 
Moléculaire Eucaryote</A>. 
C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs are guides for the 2'O-ribose methylation and 
the pseudouridilation, respectively, of rRNAs and snRNAs, although many of 
them have no documented target RNA.
<P>
Mature miRNAs (miRs) are represented by thick red blocks; the predicted 
stem-loop portions of the primary transcripts are indicated by thinner 
blocks.  When a single precursor produces two mature miRs from its 5' and 3' 
parts, both positions of the mature miRNA are individually displayed.
<P>
C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs are represented by blue and green blocks, 
respectively. At a zoomed-in resolution, arrows
superimposed on the blocks indicate the the sense orientation of the snoRNAs.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Mature and precursor miRNAs from the miRNA Registry were aligned against the 
genome using
<A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>.
The extents of the precursor sequences were not generally known and were
predicted based on base-paired hairpin structure.  The miRNA Registry is
described in Griffiths-Jones, S.,

TARGET=_blank>The microRNA Registry</A>, 
<em>Nucl. Acids Res.</em> <B>32</B>, D109-D111 (2004).
<P>
The snoRNAs from the snoRNA-LBME-DB were aligned against the human genome 
using blat.
