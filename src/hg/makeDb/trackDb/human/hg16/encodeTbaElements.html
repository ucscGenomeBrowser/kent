<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs)
derived from binCons, phastCons, and genomic evolutionary rate profiling 
(<A HREF="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/GERP/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>GERP</A>) conservation scoring
of Threaded Blockset Aligner (TBA) multiple sequence alignments in the 
ENCODE regions. The combined-methods subtracks show the union/intersection
of conserved elements produced by the three conservation methods.
<P>
The multiple sequence alignments may be viewed in the TBA Alignment
track. Another related track, TBA Cons, shows the conservation scoring. 
The descriptions accompanying these tracks detail
the methods used to create the alignments and conservation.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The locations of conserved elements are indicated by blocks in the graphical
display. This composite annotation track consists of several subtracks that
show conserved elements derived by the three methods listed above, as well as 
both unions and intersections of the sets of conserved and non-coding conserved 
elements.  To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks
you wish to hide. </P>
<P>The display may also be filtered to show only those items
with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a
threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the 
description page.</P>
<P>
Display characteristics specific to certain subtracks are described in the
respective Methods sections below.</P>
 
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
<H3>BinCons-based Elements</H3>
<P>
For each ENCODE target, a conservation score threshold was picked to match
the number of conserved bases predicted by phastCons, an alternative method
for measuring conservation. This latter method has been found slightly more
reliable for predicting the expected fraction of conserved sequence 
in each target. Clusters of bases
that exceeded the given conservation score threshold were designated 
as MCSs. The minimum length of an MCS is 25
bases. Strict cutoffs were used: if even one base fell below the
conservation score threshold, it separated an MCS into two distinct
regions.</P>

<H3>PhastCons-based Elements</H3>
<P>
The predicted MCSs are segments of the alignment that are likely to
have been &quot;generated&quot; by the conserved state of the phylo-HMM,
<em>i.e</em>., maximal segments in which the maximum-likelihood (Viterbi)
path remains in the conserved state.</P>  

<H3>GERP-based Elements</H3>
<P>
GERP elements are scored according to the inferred intensity
of purifying selection
and are measured as &quot;rejected substitutions&quot; (RSs). RSs capture the
magnitude of difference between the number of &quot;observed&quot; substitutions
(estimated using maximum likelihood) and the number that would be
&quot;expected&quot; under a neutral model of evolution.   
The RS is displayed as part of the item name.
Items with higher RSs are displayed in a darker shade of blue. The score shown 
on the details page, which has been scaled by 300 for display purposes, is 
generally not as accurate as the RS count that is part of the item name.</P>
<P>
&quot;Constrained elements&quot; are identified as those groups
of consecutive human bases that have an observed rate of evolution that is
smaller than the expected rate.  These groups of columns are merged if they
are less than a few nucleotides apart and are scored according to the sum of
the site-by-site difference between observed and expected rates (RS).</P>
<P>
Permutations of the actual alignments were analyzed, and the &quot;constrained
elements&quot identified in these permuted alignments were treated as
&quot;false positives&quot;.  Subsequently, an RS threshold was picked such
that the total length of &quot;false positive&quot;  constrained elements
(identified in the permuted alignments) was less than 5% of the length of
constrained elements identified in the actual alignment.
Thus, all annotated constrained elements are significant at better
than 95% confidence, and the total fraction of the ENCODE regions
annotated as constrained is 5-7%.</P>

<H3>PhastCons/BinCons/GERP Union/Intersection of Conserved Elements</H3>
<P>
These subtracks were produced by creating unions and intersections of the
constrained element data detected by binCons, phastCons, and GERP on TBA 
alignments. In these annotations, &quot;non-coding&quot; is defined as those 
regions not overlapping with CDS regions in any of the following UCSC gene 
tables: refFlat, knownGene, mgcGenes, vegaGene, or ensGene.</P>
