<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that 
can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/crapome/" target="_blank">download server</a>.
The exact filenames can be found in our 
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/trackDb.uniprot.ra">track configuration file</a>. 
Annotations can be converted to ASCII text by our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, for example:
<br> 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/crapome/crapome.bb -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000 stdout</tt>
