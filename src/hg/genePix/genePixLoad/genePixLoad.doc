LOADING DATA INTO GENEPIX

To load images into VisiGene we need three types of files.
  1) The images themselves, preferably in JPEG format, but
     we can convert from TIFF and most other formats as well.
  2) A file in what we call a .ra format that describes things
     that are common to all the images in a group.  
  3) A tab-separated text file that contains one line for each
     image in the submission.
In general the loading system is flexible whether information goes
in the .ra file or in the tab separated file.  

OVERVIEW OF .RA and .TAB FILES

The input to genePixLoad is a .ra file and a tab-separated file.
Both .ra and .tab files contain tagged values.  In the .ra file the tag 
is the first word of a line, and the rest of the line is the value.  Note that
blank lines are *not* allowed in the .ra file.   In the tab-separated
file the tags for each column are contained in the first row,  which
should start with a '#' character, and then contain the column names
in a tab-separated manner.  Subsequent rows contain the values for
a particular image.  The program creates the database first by looking
for fields in the tab-separated file,  and then in the .ra file.

REQUIRED FIELD IN .RA FILE

contributor - A comma separate list of contributers.  Each contributer is of
    the form last name followed by initials.  There is a period, but no space
    after each initial.  Example:  Kent W.J., Haussler D., van Braun W.S.D

REQUIRED FIELD IN .TAB FILE

fileName - The name of the image file (not including directory).  

REQUIRED FIELDS THAT CAN BE IN EITHER FILE

fullDir - The directory where the full-sized version of image lives.
screenDir - Directory where the screen-sized version of image lives.
thumbDir - Directory where thumbnail-sized version of image lives.
taxon - NCBI taxon of organism in image.
isEmbryo - 1 if it's an embryo, 0 otherwise
age - days since birth (or since fertilization for embryo)
bodyPart - Name of part of body depicted in image.  Use "whole" for whole 
    mounts.  
sliceType - whole mount, frontal, sagittal, transverse, etc.
probeColor - color of probe

OPTIONAL FIELDS (WITH DEFAULT VALUES IF ANY IN BRACKETS)

abName - Name of antibody used as probe
abDescription - Description of antibody used as prob
abTaxon - Taxon of animal antibody isolated from
embedding - usually either 'cryosection' or 'paraffin'
fixation - formaldehyde, methanol, etc
fPrimer - Forward PCR primer used to generate RNA probe
genbank - Genbank/EMBL accession 
gene - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee or other official gene symbol
genotype - 'wild type' or comma separated list of mutations
imagePos [0] - Zero based index of image in file
itemUrl - Contributor-supplied URL associated with this particular image.  Should
    have a %s where submitId gets substituted in.
journal - Name of journal
journalUrl - Main URL of journal.
locusLink - LocusLink/Entrez Gene ID
priority [200] - sort order.  Lower numbers shown first.
refSeq - RefSeq mRNA accession
rPrimer - Reverse PCR primer used to generate RNA probe
sectionIx [0] - zero based index of section in sectionSet
sectionSet - an identifier that groups together sections of same sample
strain - particular strain of specimen (eg C57BL for a mouse)
submitId - an ID to substitute into itemUrl for image.
treatment - describes treatment of sample
publication - Title of associated publication
pubUrl URL of associated publication
setUrl - Contributor-supplied URL associated with whole submitted set of images
seq - probe sequence
uniProt - Uniprot accession
