<P>
This track shows the sequences used in the Jun. 2006 $organism genome assembly.

Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI

TARGET=_blank>assembly documentation</A>.<BR>
NCBI also provides

The definition of this assembly is from the

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
