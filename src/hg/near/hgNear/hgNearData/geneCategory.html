<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This column shows the category of the gene: 
<UL>
<LI><B>coding</B> -- transcripts for which the evidence is sufficiently good 
that they produce proteins. 
<LI><B>nearCoding</B> -- transcripts that overlap coding transcripts by at least
20 bases on the same strand, but do not seem to produce protein products 
themselves. Often this is because they are splicing variants with introns after 
the stop codon, and therefore undergo nonsense mediated decay. 
<LI><B>antisense</B> -- transcripts that overlap coding transcripts by at least 
20 bases on the oppposite strand. 
<LI><B>noncoding</B> -- transcripts that do not fall into the three 
previous categories.
