		    <P>
		    The Sep. 2007 EquCab2 release of the horse genome (Equus 
		    caballus) is now available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This 
		    assembly, UCSC version equCab2, was produced by the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.broad.mit.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Broad 
		    Institute</A>. </P>
		    <P>
		    The horse draft genome has been sequenced to 6.8X coverage. 
		    Approximately 84% of the sequence has been anchored to 
		    chromosomes, which include autosomes 1-31 and sex 
		    chromosome X. Unanchored contigs that could not be 
		    localized to a chromosome have been concatenated into the 
		    virtual chromosome &quot;chrUn&quot;, separated by gaps of 
		    1,000 bp. The mitochondrial sequence is also available in
		    the Genome Browser as the virtual chromosome 
		    &quot;chrM&quot;. 
		    <P>
		    For more details about the current assembly, see 
		    the Broad Institute 
		    <A HREF="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mammals/horse/"
		    TARGET=_blank>Horse Genome Project</A> page. </P>
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		    available from the Genome Browser

		    <P>
		    We have updated the initial UCSC Medaka Genome Browser 
		    (oryLat1) to correct an error with chrUn in which the gap 
		    relationships between the contigs within their 
		    ultracontigs were incorrect.
