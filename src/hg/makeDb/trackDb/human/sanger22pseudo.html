<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains curated annotations of chromosome 22 produced by the
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr22/" TARGET=_blank>Chromosome 
22 Group</A> at the Sanger Institute. They are described in the 
paper Collins, J.E. <em>et al</em>.

<P>
Over 10% of the human genome, including two complete
chromosomes &mdash; <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr20/" 
TARGET=_blank>20</A> and <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr22/" 
TARGET=_blank>22<A> &mdash; have been annotated by the Sanger Institute Sequence
Annotation Team in collaboration with the individual 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Humana/" TARGET=_blank>chromosome 
project teams</A>.</P> 
<P>
NOTE: Sanger22 annotations appear only on chromosome 22 in the Genome Browser.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Finished genomic sequence is analyzed on a clone by clone basis using a
combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases as
well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (Genscan, Fgenesh). 
Gene structures are annotated on the basis of human interpretation of the
combined supportive evidence generated during sequence analysis. In
parallel, experimental methods are applied to extend incomplete
gene structures and discover new genes. The latter is initiated by
comparative analysis of the finished sequence with vertebrate datasets
such as the Riken mouse cDNAs, mouse whole-genome shotgun data and
GenescopeTetraodon Ecores.</P>
