<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows elements that are predicted to be under lineage-specific
selection, according to the DLESS (Detection of LinEage Specific
Selection) program.  Three types of elements are identified: elements
"conserved" across all species, elements "gained" (i.e., that have come
under selection) on some branch of the phylogeny, and elements "lost"
(i.e., released from selection) on some branch of the phylogeny.
Currently, DLESS allows for negative selection only and permits at most one
gain or loss event per element.  Thus, sequences that are conserved
(relative to a model of neutral evolution) in some subtree of the
phylogeny, but are not especially conserved in the complementary
"supertree," are predicted as "gains," and sequences that are conserved in
some supertree but not in the complementary subtree are predicted as "losses."
Sequences that are conserved across the whole tree are simply labeled
"conserved." </P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
Predicted conserved elements are shown in black, gains are shown in green,
and losses are shown in red.  Gains and losses are labeled with two species
names indicating the branch of the phylogeny on which the event in question
is predicted to have occurred.  For example, a gain labeled "rat-mouse" is
predicted to have occurred on the branch above the most recent common
ancestor of rat and mouse (i.e., it is a rodent-specific conserved
element).  By clicking on an element in "pack" or "full" mode you can
obtain a details page summarizing the support for the prediction.  This
page includes various statistics and p-values computed by the phyloP
program. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DLESS was run on the NHGRI/PSU TBA alignments of the sequences from the September
2005 ENCODE data freeze.  Only the 17 mammals that are well represented
across ENCODE targets were included.  The non-mammalian vertebrates were
excluded because they can only be aligned in conserved regions.  The
program was given a phylogeny and model of neutral substitution estimated
from fourfold degenerate sites in coding regions, using the phyloFit
program.  (The tree topology was held fixed; we assumed the same topology
as for the other ENCODE analyses.)  A rendering of the estimated neutral
phylogeny, showing the 17 species at the leaves and estimated branch
lengths in expected substitutions per site, is available <A
href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~acs/encode17.pdf">here</A>. </P>

<P>
The parameters that define DLESS's HMM and indel model were estimated by
maximum likelihood.  The following values were used: --expected-length
20 --target-coverage 0.055 --phi 0.261
--indel-model 0.0334,0.0533,0.0529,0.0117,0.0206,0.0654</P>

<P>
After predicted elements were obtained using DLESS, p-values for each
element were computed using phyloP.  Only predictions with p-values of less
than 0.05 were included in the track (conditional p-values in the case of
lineage-specific elements; see Siepel et al., 2006).</P>

<P>
DLESS is based on a phylo-HMM with states for neutrally evolving and
conserved regions, and for gains and losses on each branch of the tree.  It
uses insertions and deletions as well as substitutions in identifying
elements under selection.  PhyloP computes p-values based on prior and
posterior distributions of the number of substitutions, as implied by a
model of neutral substitution.  These distributions are obtained using a
dynamic programming algorithm.  Details are given in Siepel et al. (2006).</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
DLESS and phyloP were written by Adam Siepel, based on ideas worked out in
collaboration with Katie Pollard and David Haussler.  Thanks to Elliott
Margulies for providing the model of neutral substitution, and to Brian
Raney for preprocessing the alignments to distinguish between indels and
missing data.</P>
