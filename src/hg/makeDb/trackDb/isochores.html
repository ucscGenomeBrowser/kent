<H3>What's an Isochore</H3>
<P>Isochores describe a region of a chromosome where the CG-content is
either higher or lower than the whole genome average (42%).  A CG-rich
isochore is given a dark color, while a CG-poor isochore is a light
color.  </P>
<P>Isochores were determined by first calculating the CG-content of 100,000bp
windows across the genome.  These windows were either labeled H or L
depending on whether the window contained a higher or lower GC-content
than average.  A two-state HMM was created in which one state represented
GC-rich regions, and the other GC-poor.  It was trained using the first 12
chromosomes. The trained HMM was used to generate traces over all chromosomes.
These traces define the boundaries of the isochores,
and their type (GC-rich or AT-rich).</P>
