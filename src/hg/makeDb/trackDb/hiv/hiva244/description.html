This HIV genome assembly 
is based on the A244 (gp120) vaccine antigen sequence from VaxGen, which was used for its HIV-1 vaccine design.

This browser shows gene regions, locations of protein domains, and 
viral sequences collected during the VaxGen VAX004 and VAX003 HIV 
vaccine clinical trials.

(Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases)</A>
HIV vaccine project.

The annotation tracks displayed in the GSID HIV Data Browser were generated by UCSC 
and collaborators.  See the
