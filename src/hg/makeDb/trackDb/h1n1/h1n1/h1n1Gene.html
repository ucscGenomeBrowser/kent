<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows known H1N1 genes based on data from GISAID EpiFlu Database</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A typical set of H1N1 DNA sequences from the GISAID EpiFlu 
Database is aligned to the H1N1 base genome using BLAT.  
The start and end positions of the resulting alignments were used to create this track in BED format.
