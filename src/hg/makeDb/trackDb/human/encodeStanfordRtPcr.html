<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays absolute transcript copy numbers for 136 genes and
12 negative control intergenic regions, determined by RTPCR in HCT116 cells.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The genomic regions are indicated by solid blocks. The shade of an item gives a 
rough indication of its count, ranging from light gray for zero to black for a 
count of 7000 or greater. To display only those items that exceed a specific 
unnormalized score, enter a minimum score between 0 and 1000 in the text box at 
the top of the track description page. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Total RNA was prepared in quadruplicate from HCT116 cells grown in
culture.  cDNA was prepared as described in Trinklein <em>et
al</em>. (2004).  Duplicate primer pairs were designed to each gene, and the
absolute number of cDNA molecules containing each amplicon were
determined by real-time PCR.  The submitted data are the calculated
number of molecules of each transcript containing the defined
amplicon.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Four biological replicates were performed, and two primer pairs were
used to measure the abundance of each transcript.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were generated in the Richard M. Myers lab 
at Stanford University (now at <a href="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab" target="_blank">
HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology</a>).
