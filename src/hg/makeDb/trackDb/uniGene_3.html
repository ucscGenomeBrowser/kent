<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the UniGene genes from NCBI. Each UniGene entry is a set of transcript sequences
that appear to come from the same transcription locus (gene or expressed pseudogene), together with
information on protein similarities, gene expression, cDNA clone reagents, and genomic location.
</p>

<p>
Coding exons are represented by blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns. In full
display mode, arrowheads on the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
The UniGene sequence file, Hs.seq.uniq.gz, is downloaded from NCBI. Sequences are aligned to base
genome using BLAT to create this track.
</p>

<p>
When a single UniGene gene aligned in multiple places, the alignment having the highest base
identity was found. Only alignments having a base identity level within 0.2% of the best and
at least 96.5% base identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
