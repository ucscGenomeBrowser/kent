<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
RNA (from a commercial source) from 11 tissues were hybrized to Affymetrix 
Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays. For each tissue, 3 replicate experiments were done 
for a total of 33 arrays.  The arrays' raw signal intensity was normalized
with a quantile normalization method, then run through the PLIER algorithm.
The normalized data were then converted to log-ratios, which are displayed
as green for negative log-ratios (underexpression), and red for positive 
(overexpression).</P>
