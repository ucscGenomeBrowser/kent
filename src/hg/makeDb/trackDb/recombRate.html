<H2>Description</H2> 
<P>
The recombination rate track represents
calculated sex-averaged rates of recombination based on either the
deCODE, Marshfield, or Genethon genetic maps.  By default, the deCODE
map rates are displayed.  Female- and male-specific recombination
rates, as well as rates from the Marshfield and Genethon maps, can
also be displayed by choosing the appropriate filter option on the track 
description page.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The deCODE genetic map was created at 
<A HREF="http://www.decode.com/" TARGET=_blank>deCODE Genetics</A> and is 
based on 5,136 microsatellite markers for 146 families with a total
of 1,257 meiotic events.  For more information on this map, see
Kong, <em>et al.</em>, 2002.</P>
<P>
The Marshfield genetic map was created at the 
<a href="http://research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics/home/index.asp"
target="_blank">Center for Medical Genetics</a> and is based on 8,325 short 
tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) for 8 CEPH families consisting of 134
individuals with 186 meioses.  For more information on this map, see 
Broman <em>et al.</em>, 1998. </P>
<P>
The Genethon genetic map was created at 
<a href="http://www.genethon.fr/en/"
target="_blank">Genethon</a> and is based on 5,264 microsatellites for 8 CEPH 
families consisting of 134 individuals with 186 meioses. For more information 
on this map, see 
Dib <em>et al.</em>, 1996. </P>
<P>
Each base is assigned the recombination rate calculated by
assuming a linear genetic distance across the immediately flanking
genetic markers. The recombination rate assigned to each 1 Mb window
is the average recombination rate of the bases contained within the
window. </P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
This track has a filter that can be used to change the map or
gender-specific rate displayed. The filter is located at the top of the track 
description page, which is accessed via the small button to the left of 
the track's graphical display or through the link on the track's control menu.
To view a particular map or gender-specific rate, select the corresponding
option from the &quot;Map Distances&quot; pulldown list. By default, the 
browser displays the deCODE sex-averaged distances.</P>
<P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> 
button.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
This track was produced at UCSC using data that are freely available for
the Genethon, Marshfield, and deCODE genetic maps (see above links).  Thanks
to all who played a part in the creation of these maps. </P>
