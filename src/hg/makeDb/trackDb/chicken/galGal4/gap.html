<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the exception of
intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the finishing process. 
</p>

<p>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track. If the relative order and orientation
of the contigs on either side of the gap are known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a
white line is drawn through the black box representing the gap. 
</p>

<p>
This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<ul>
<li><b>Fragment</b> - Gaps between the contigs of a draft clone.
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)</li>
<li><b>Contig</b> - Whole genome sequence contigs.</li>
<li><b>Other</b> - Sequences of gaps not marked in the assembly AGP files.</li>
</ul>
</p>
