<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows data from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30348985/">
<em>Single cell RNA sequencing of human liver reveals distinct intrahepatic
macrophage populations</em></a>. Liver tissue was analyzed using single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent clustering distinguished 20
hepatic cell populations based on their identified marker genes found in
MacParland <em>et al</em>., 2018.</p>

<p>
There are three bar chart tracks in this track collection with liver cells
grouped by either broad cell type (Liver Broad), cell type (Liver Cells) and
donor (Liver Donor). The default track displayed is liver cells grouped by cell
type.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<!--
 immune (9)
 endothelial (3)
 epithelial (1)
 fibroblast (2)
 stem cell (1)
 hepatocyte (2)
-->

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>

</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated 
with those classes.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Fresh liver samples were taken from 5 neurologically deceased donors (NDD)
deemed acceptable for liver transplantation. The caudate lobe of the liver was
surgically separated and flushed with HTK solution to leave only tissue
resident cells that were used to prepare a cell suspension for scRNA-seq
analysis. Samples were prepared using 10x Genomics 3' v2 library kit and
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. A total of 8,444 transcriptional profiles
were obtained for organ specific and non-organ specific cells from healthy
hepatic tissue.</p>

<p>The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the 
<a href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=covid19atlas%2Fc19a-macparland18">UCSC Cell Browser</a>.
The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed were used 
to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be visualized. The coloring 
was done by defining colors for the broad level cell classes and then using another UCSC tool,
hcaColorCells, to interpolate the colors across all cell types.</p>
