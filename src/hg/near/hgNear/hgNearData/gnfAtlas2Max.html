<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This shows the maximum absolute expression level for any tissue in
the GNF Gene Expression Atlas 2.  Most of the values fall in the zero to 
50,000 range, but a few outliers may range as high as 200,000. A value of 
less than 20 indicates the expression could not be detected in any tissue 
at levels significantly above the cross-hybridization controls.  </P>
