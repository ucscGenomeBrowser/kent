<B>Sharp subtrack: </B>On the details pages for elements in this subtrack, 
the table shows value/threshold data for each individual in the population.
&quot;Value&quot; is defined as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of fluorescence intensity of
test versus reference DNA. &quot;Threshold&quot; is defined as 2 standard 
deviations from the mean log<sub>2</sub> ratio of all autosomal clones per 
hybridization. 
The &quot;Disease Percent&quot; value reflects the percent of the BAC that lies 
within a &quot;rearrangement hotspot&quot;, as defined in Sharp <em>et al</em>. 
(2005) (the rationale used to choose BACs for the array construction). A 
rearrangement hotspot is defined by the presence of flanking intrachromosomal 
duplications &gt;10 kb in length with &gt;95% similarity and separated by 
50 kb - 10 Mb of intervening sequence.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>Sharp BAC microarray analysis</H3>
<P>
All hybridizations were all performed in duplicate incorporating a dye-reversal 
using a custom array consisting of 2194 end-sequence or FISH-confirmed BACs, 
targeted to regions of the genome flanked by segmental duplications. 
The false positive rate was estimated at ~3 clones per 4,000 tested.</P>

<H3>Iafrate BAC microarray analysis</H3>
<P>
All hybridizations were performed in duplicate incorporating a dye-reversal 
using proprietary 1 Mb GenomeChip V1.2 Human BAC Arrays consisting of 2,632 BAC 
clones (Spectral Genomics, Houston, TX). The false positive rate was estimated 
at ~1 clone per 5,264 tested. </P>
<P>
Further information is available from the 
<A HREF="http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/" TARGET=_blank>Database of Genome 
Variants</A> website.</P>

<H3>Sebat ROMA</H3>
<P>
Following digestion with BglII or HindIII, genomic DNA was hybridized to a 
custom array consisting of 85,000 oligonucleotide probes. The probes were 
selected to be free of common repeats and have unique homology within the human 
genome. The average resolution of the array was ~35kb; however, only intervals 
in which three consecutive probes showed concordant signal were scored as 
CNPs. All hybridizations were performed in duplicate incorporating a 
dye-reversal, with the false positive rate estimated to be ~6%.</P>
<P>
Note that CNP intervals, as detailed by Sebat <em>et al</em>. (2004), were 
converted from the April 2003 human genome assembly (NCBI Build 33) to the 
July 2003 assembly (NCBI Build 34) using the UCSC liftOver tool.</P>

<H3>Tuzun fosmid mapping</H3>
<P>
Paired-end sequences from a human fosmid DNA library were mapped to the assembly. 
The average resolution of this 
technique was ~8kb, and included 56 sites of inversion not detectable by 
the array-based approaches.  However, because of the physical constraints of 
fosmid insert size, this technique was unable to detect insertions greater than 
40 kb in size.</P>

<H3>McCarroll genotype analysis</H3>
<P>
A segregating deletion can leave 'footprints' in SNP genotype data, including
apparent deviations from mendelian inheritance, apparent deviations from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and null genotypes.  Using these clues to discover
true variants is challenging, however, because the vast majority of such observations
represent technical artifacts and genotyping errors.
</P>
<P>
To determine whether a subset of 'failed' SNP genotyping assays in the HapMap data
might reflect structural variation, the authors examined whether such failures
are physically clustered in a manner that is specific to individuals.  Consistent
with this hypothesis, the rate of mendeliam-inconsistent genotypes was elevated
near other mendelian-inconsistent genotypes in the same individual but was unrelated to
mendelian inconsistencies in other individuals.
</P>
<P>
The authors systematically looked for regions of the genome in which the
same failure profile appeared repeatedly at nearby markers in a manner that
was statistically unexpected based on chance.  A set of statistical thresholds was 
tailored to each mode of failure, genotyping center and genotyping platform used in the
project.  The same procedure could readily apply to dense SNP data from any
platform or study.</P>


<H3>Conrad genotype analysis</H3>
<P>
SNPs in regions that are hemizygous for a deletion are generally miscalled as homozygous 
for the allele that is present.  Hence, when a deletion is transmitted from parent to child, 
the genotypes at SNPs within the deletion region will often appear to violate the rules of Mendelian 
transmission.  The authors developed a simple algorithm for scanning trio data for unusual runs of 
consecutive SNPs that, in a single family, have genotype configurations consistent with the presence of a deletion. 

<H3>Hinds haploid hybridization analysis</H3>
<P>
Approximately 600 Mb of genomic DNA from 24 unrelated individuals
was obtained from the Polymorphism Discovery Resource.
Haploid hybridization was used to identify genomic intervals
showing a reduced hybridization signal in comparison to the reference
assembly.   PCR amplification was performed on 215 candidate deletions.
100 deletions were selected that were unambiguously confirmed.
<H2>Validation</H2>
<H3>McCarroll genotype analysis</H3>
<P>
Four methods of validation were used: 
fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH), 
two-color fluorescence intensity measurements, PCR amplification and quantitative PCR.
</P>
<P>
The authors performed fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH) for five
candidate deletions large enough to span available FISH probes.  In all five cases,
FISH assays confirmed the deletions in the predicted individuals.
</P>
<P>
The authors examined two-color allele-specific fluorescence data from SNP genotyping
assays from a subset of data available at the Broad by looking for a reduction in
fluorescence intensity in individuals predicted to carry a deletion.  At most SNPs
in the genome, fluorescence intensity measurements cluster into two or three
discrete groups corresponding to homozygous and hetrozygous genotypes.
At 15 of 17 candidate deletion loci, fluorescence intensity data for one or more
SNPs clustered into additional groups that corresponded to the predicted deletion
genotypes.
</P>
<P>
The authors used PCR amplification to query 60 loci for which the pattern of genotypes
suggested multiple individuals with homozygous deletions.  Variants were considered
confirmed if the pattern of amplication success and failure matched prediction
across a set of 12-24 individuals.   The authors confirmed 51 of 60 candidate
variants by this criterion.
</P>
<P>
The authors performed quantitative PCR in all 269 HapMap DNA samples for 11 candidate
deletions that overlapped the coding exons of genes and that were discovered in
many individuals: at 10/11 loci, the authors observed three discrete clusters, identifying 
individuals with zero, one and two gene copies.
All 60 trios displayed mendelian inheritance for the ten deletions, as well as
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all four populations surveyed, and transmission rates
close to 50%.   This suggests that the deletions behave as a stable, heritable
genetic polymorphism.
</P>

<H3>Conrad genotype analysis</H3>
<P>
The authors first tested 12 predicted deletions using quantitative PCR. 
For all 12 deletions they observed DNA concentrations consistent with transmission of a deletion 
from parent to child. 
<P>To provide more extensive validation by comparative genome hybridization (CGH), the authors designed a 
custom oligonucleotide microarray comprised of 380,000 probes that tile across all 134 candidate deletions 
identified in nine HapMap offspring (8 YRI and 1 CEU). 
The results of this CGH analysis indicate that the majority (about 85%) of candidate deletions detected 
by the method are real.
