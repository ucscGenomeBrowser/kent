<H2>Description:</H2>

<P>This ENCODE track maps
human transcription factor binding sites, 
genome-wide using second generation 
massively parallel sequencing.  
This mapping uses expressed transcription factors 
as GFP tagged fusion proteins after BAC 
(Bacterial artificial chromosomes) recombineering. 

<P>The U. of Chicago and Max Planck Institute
(Dresden) pipeline generates
recombineered (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) 
BACs for the production of cell lines or animals that
express fusion proteins from epitope tagged transgenes.  
</P>

</P>

<H3>Recombineering strategy:</H3>
<P>To facilitate high-throughput production of the transgenic
constructs, the program BACFinder (Crowe, Rana et al. 2002) automatically
selects the most suitable BAC clone for any given human gene and
generates the sets of PCR primers required for tagging and
verification (Poser, Sarov et al. 2008). Recombineering
is used for tagging cassettes at either the N or C terminus of the
protein. The N-terminal cassette has a dual eukaryotic-prokaryotic
promoter (PGK-gb2) driving a neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene
within an artificial intron inside the tag coding sequence. The
selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently
removed by Cre recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette
contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal
ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance
gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3) drives the
expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in <i>E. coli</i>. 
</P>

<P>The tagging cassettes, containing 50 nucleotides of
PCR-introduced homology arms are inserted into the BAC by recombineering, either
behind the start codon (for the N-terminal tag) or in front of the
stop codon (for the C-terminal tag) of the gene. <i>E. coli</i> cells that have
successfully recombined the cassette are selected for kanamycin
resistance in liquid culture.  Each saturated culture from a specific 
recombineering reaction derived 10-200 independent recombination events.  
</P>

<P>Checking two independent clones for each PCR through
the tag insertion point, 97% (85/88) yielded a PCR product of the expected
size. Most of the clones that failed to grow were missing the targeted genomic
region. An estimated 10% of the BACs used are
chimeric, rearranged or wrongly mapped. Thus,
initial results indicate that the necessary recombineering steps can
be carried out with high fidelity. 
</P>

<P>The White lab produced all epitope
tagged transcription and chromatin factor BACs, as well as the genome
wide ChIP data and analysis.  An application
of this approach to the analysis of closely related paralogs (RARa and
RARg) yielded transcription factors, chromatin factors, cell lines, 
ChIP chip data and ChIP-seq data
(Hua, Kittler et al. Cell 2009). 
Such paralogous transcription factors often can not otherwise 
be distinguished by antibodies.  
</P>
    
<H3>Sample Preparation</H3>

<P>ChIP DNA from samples are sheared to &#126;800bp using a nebulizer. 
The ends of the DNA are polished, and two unique adapters are ligated to the fragments. 
Ligated fragments of 150-200bp are isolated by gel extraction 
and amplified using limited cycles of PCR.
</P>

<H3>Sequencing System</H3>

<P>Illumina GAIIx and HySeq next-generation sequencing produced all ChIP-seq data.
</P>

<H3>Processing and Analysis Software</H3>

<P>Raw sequencing reads are aligned using Bowtie version 0.12.5
(Langmead et al. 2009).  The &quot;-m 1&quot; parameter is applied to suppress alignments mapping more than once in the genome.  
Reads are aligned to the UCSC hg19 assembly. 
Wiggle format signal files are generated with SPP 2.7.1 for R 2.7.1.  
Macs 1.3.7 is used to call peaks.  
The Macs parameters used vary by experiment.
</P>
<P>
The White lab used goat anti-GFP antibody to perform ChIP in untagged K562 cells as a background control. 
The test IP was performed in the same way as the background control. Results are expressed as values 
of the test normalized to the background.
