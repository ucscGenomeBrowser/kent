<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  
</P>
<P>
This is a 6X coverage assembly.  There are 49,724 supercontigs with a total of
3,029,401,840 bases.  The largest contig is Contig1, with a size of 2,551,648 bases.
Half of the sequence is contained in the 2,807 largest contigs of size
303,219 bases (N50) or larger.  The average contig size is 60,924 bases,
the median contig size is 8.789 bases.  See also:

</P>

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>

All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;W&quot;:
