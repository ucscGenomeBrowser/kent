<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Repetitive genomic elements including Transposable Element (TE) families, Satellite, Short Tandem Repeats,
  and low complexity DNA as annotated by RepeatMasker.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<h4>Context Sensitive Zooming</h4>
<p>
  This track employs a technique which chooses the appropriate visual representation for the data based on the
  zoom scale, and or the number of annotations currently in view.  The track will automatically switch from the
  most detailed visualization ('Full' mode) to the denser view ('Pack' mode) when the window size is greater
  than 45kb of sequence.  It will further switch to the even denser single line view ('Dense' mode) if more than
  500 annotations are present in the current view.
</p>
<h4>Dense Mode Visualization</h4>
<p>
  In dense display mode, a single line is displayed denoting the coverage of repeats using a series
  of colored boxes.  The boxes are colored based on the classification of the repeat (see below for legend).
<br>
<br>

</p>
<h4>Pack Mode Visualization</h4>
<p>
  In pack mode, repeats are represented as sets of joined features.  These are color coded as above based on the
  class of the repeat, and the further details such as orientation (denoted by chevrons) and a 
  family label are provided.
  This family label may be optionally turned off in the track configuration.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
  The pack display mode may also be configured to resemble the original UCSC repeat track.
  In this visualization 
  repeat features are grouped by classes (see below), and displayed on separate track lines.  
  The repeat ranges are
  denoted as grayscale boxes, reflecting both the size of the repeat and
  the amount of base mismatch, base deletion, and base insertion associated with a repeat element.
  The higher the combined number of these, the lighter the shading.
<br>
<br>

</p>
<h4>Full Mode Visualization</h4>
<p>
  In the most detailed visualization repeats are displayed as chevron boxes, indicating the size and orientation of 
  the repeat.  The interior grayscale shading represents the divergence of the repeat (see above) 
  while the outline color
  represents the class of the repeat. Dotted lines above the repeat and extending left or right
  indicate the length of unaligned repeat model sequence and provide context for where 
  a repeat fragment originates in its
  consensus or pHMM model.  If the length of the unaligned sequence
  is large, an interruption line and bp size is indicated instead of drawing the extension to scale.
<br>
<br>

</p>
<p>
  For example, the following repeat is a SINE element in the forward orientation with average
  divergence. Only the 5' proximal fragment of the consensus sequence is aligned to the genome.
  The 3' unaligned length (384bp) is not drawn to scale and is instead displayed using a set of
  interruption lines along with the length of the unaligned sequence.
</p>

<p>
  Repeats that have been fragmented by insertions or large internal deletions are now represented
  by join lines.  In the example below, a LINE element is found as two fragments.  The solid
  connection lines indicate that there are no unaligned consensus bases between the two fragments.
  Also note these fragments form the 3' extremity of the repeat, as there is no unaligned consensus
  sequence following the last fragment.
</p>

<p>
  In cases where there is unaligned consensus sequence between the fragments, the repeat will look like
  the following.  The dotted line indicates the length of the unaligned sequence between the two
  fragments.  In this case the unaligned consensus is longer than the actual genomic distance between
  these two fragments.
</p>

<p>
  If there is consensus overlap between the two fragments, the joining lines will be drawn to indicate
  how much of the left fragment is repeated in the right fragment.

<p>
  A &quot;?&quot; at the end of the &quot;Family&quot; or &quot;Class&quot; (for example, DNA?)
  signifies that the curator was unsure of the classification. At some point in the future,
  either the &quot;?&quot; will be removed or the classification will be changed.</p>
