<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays <A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> alignments of the Feb. 2002 mouse draft
assembly to the human genome.

<H2>Methods</H2>
Blastz uses 12 of 19 seeds and this matrix: 
<br>
<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>  A</td><td>  C</td><td>  G</td><td>  T</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;91</td><td>-114</td><td>&nbsp;-31</td><td>-123</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>-114</td><td>&nbsp;100</td><td>-125</td><td>&nbsp;-31</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>&nbsp;-31</td><td>-125</td><td>&nbsp;100</td><td>-114</td></tr>
<tr><td>T</td><td>-123</td><td>&nbsp;-31</td><td>-114</td><td>&nbsp;91</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
  O = 400, E = 30, K = 3000, L = 3000, M = 50
<br><br>
A second pass is done at reduced stringency (7mer seeds and
MSP threshold of K=2200) to attempt to fill in gaps of up to about 10K bp.
Lineage specific repeats are abridged during this alignment.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to turn on the chromosome color track or to
filter the display output by chromosome.
<UL>
<LI><B>Color track</B> To display the chromosome color track, click the <I>on</I>
button next to &quot;Color track based on chromosome&quot;. When the color track is
activated, each of the items within the annotation track will be colored to
show the chromosome in the genome assembly from which the alignment
originated.
<LI><B>Chromosome filter</B>: To display only alignments from a specific
chromomsome in the aligning assembly, enter the chromosome number (in the form
chrN) in the text box to the right of &quot;Filter by chromosome&quot;. For example, to
display alignments from chromosome 6, type &quot;chr6&quot;.
</UL></P>
When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.
