<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence.  When possible scaffolds were grouped
into ultracontigs.  When possible ultracontigs were assembled into chromosomes.

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
All components within this track, except chrM, are of fragment
type &quot;W&quot;: Whole Genome Shotgun contig.  The mitochrondial
sequence is type &quot;F&quot;: Finished.  (GI:25057156, NC_004387.1)
