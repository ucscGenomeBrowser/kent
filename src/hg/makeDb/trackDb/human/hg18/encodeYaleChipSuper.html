<H2>Overview</H2>
<P>
This super-track combines related tracks of ChIP-chip data generated
by the Yale ENCODE group.
ChIP-chip, also known as genome-wide location analysis, is a technique for
isolation and identification of DNA sequences bound by specific proteins in
cells, including histones. Histone methylation and acetylation serves as a
stable genomic imprint
that regulates gene expression and other epigenetic
phenomena.  These histones are found in transcriptionally active domains
called euchromatin.</P>

<P>
These tracks contain ChIP-chip data of multiple transcription factors such as 
STAT1 and
histones in multiple cell lines such as

(cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma). Data are displayed as signals, p-values
and site predictions, as well as Regulatory
Factor Binding Regions (RFBR) predictions.

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
These data were generated and analyzed by the labs of Michael
Snyder, Mark Gerstein and Sherman Weissman at Yale University. The PCR
Amplicon arrays were manufactured by Bing Ren's lab at UCSD.</P>
<P>
The RFBR data set was made available by the Transcriptional Regulation Group 
of the
ENCODE Project Consortium. The RFBR cluster and desert tracks were generated
by Zhengdong Zhang from Mark Gerstein's group at Yale University.
