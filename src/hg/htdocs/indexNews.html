Updated Chimpanzee Browser Released</B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    We are happy to announce the release of a Genome Browser for
		    the latest release of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) 
		    genome. The Oct. 2010 assembly -- CGSC v2.1.3,
		    UCSC version panTro3 -- was produced by the 
		    <A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/genome.cgi?GENOME=Pan%20troglodytes&SECTION=collaborators"
		    TARGET=_BLANK>Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis 
		    Consortium</A>.</P>
		    <P>
		    This assembly covers about 97 percent of the genome and is 
		    based on 6X sequence coverage. It comprises 192,898 contigs 
		    with an N50 length of 44 kb and 33,990 supercontigs with an
		    N50 length of 8.4 Mb.  
		    Improvements introduced with the 2.1.3 assembly include the 
		    addition of over 300,000 finishing reads and the merging in 
		    of 640 finished BACS. Approximately 49,000 additional merges
		    were made in this assembly as compared with the 2.1 
		    assembly.
		    <P>
		    The whole genome shotgun data were derived primarily from 
		    the donor Clint, a captive-born male chimpanzee from the 
		    Yerkes Primate Research Center in Atlanta, GA, USA. 
		    The sequence data were assembled and organized by the 
		    Washington University Genome Center. The underlying whole 
		    genome shotgun data were generated at the Washington 
		    University School of Medicine and the Broad Institute. 
		    For detailed information about the assembly 
		    process, see the sequencing and analysis discussion in the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AACZ00000000"
		    TARGET=_blank>GenBank accession record</A>.
		    </P>
		    <P>
		    Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		    available via the Genome Browser 
		    <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/panTro3/">FTP
		    server</A> or the 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#chimp">Downloads</A> 
		    page. The complete set of sequence reads is available at the

		    <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces" 
		    TARGET=_blank>NCBI trace archive</A>. These data have 
		    <A HREF="goldenPath/credits.html#chimp_use">specific
		    conditions for use</A>.</P>
		    <P>
		    We'd like to thank the International Chimpanzee 
		    Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, Washington 
		    University at St. Louis School of Medicine Genome Sequencing
		    Center, and the Broad Institute for providing this assembly.
		    We'd also like to acknowledge the UCSC team who worked on 
		    this release: Hiram Clawson, Greg Roe, and Donna Karolchik. 
		    The chimpanzee browser annotation tracks were generated by 
		    UCSC and collaborators worldwide. </P>

Searching for Tracks Just Got Easier! </B></FONT>
		    With our latest Genome Browser release, we've introduced a 
		    new track search feature that will help you to quickly and 
		    easily find and display specific annotation data sets. The 
		    search feature is available via the "track search" button 
		    on the browser gateway and tracks display pages.
