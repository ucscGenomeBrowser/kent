<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34062119/" target="_blank"><em>Integrated analysis of
multimodal single-cell data</em></a>. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) taken from pre-vaccinated and post-vaccinated individuals were profiled
using both CITE-seq and ECCITE-seq. A total of 57 cell type clusters were
identified and each cluster included cells from all 24 samples with rare
exceptions. This dataset contains three annotations for cell clustering: Level
1 (8 cell types), Level 2 (30 cell types), Level 3 (57 cell types).</p>

<p>
This track collection contains six bar chart tracks of RNA expression in PBMCs
where cells are grouped by cell type level 1
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoCellType">Blood PBMC Cells</a>), cell type
level 2 (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoL2">Blood PBMC Cells 2</a>), cell type level 3
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoL3">Blood PBMC Cells 3</a>), donor
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoDonor">Blood PBMC Donor</a>), phase of cell cycle
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoPhase">Blood PBMC Phase</a>), or time into
experiment (<a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoTime">Blood PBMC Time</a>).
The default track displayed is <a href="hgTrackUi?g=bloodHaoCellType">Blood PBMC Cells</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
PBMC samples were taken from 8 volunteers ages 20-49 enrolled in an HIV
vaccine trial (NCT01578889). A total of 24 blood samples were collected at 3
time points: day 0 (the day before), day 3, and day 7 after the administration
of a VSV-vectored HIV vaccine. Samples were collected at these different time
points to minimize batch effects. Cells were then divided into separate
aliquots for modified versions of the 3' CITE-seq and 5' ECCITE-seq staining
protocols. In the 3' CITE-seq staining protocol, the samples are simultaneously
stained with the antibody and unique hashtag. Whereas, 5' ECCITE-seq samples
are stained first with a unique hashtag. 3' libraries were loaded into 8 lanes
of a 10x Genomics Chip B using the 10x Genomics 3' v3 kit. 5' libraries
were loaded into 2 lanes of a 10x Genomics Chip A using the 10x Genomics V(D)J
kit (v1). Both 3' and 5' libraries were pooled together and sequenced on an
Illumina Novaseq S4 flowcell. In total, 210,911 cells were profiled after 
quality control and doublet filtration.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=multimodal-pbmc+sct" target="_blank">UCSC Cell 
Browser</a>. The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, 
and bedToBigBed were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file 
that can be visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad 
level cell classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate 
the colors across all cell types. The UCSC tools can be found on our download
server: <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
