<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Release 2.0 assembly includes both raw whole genome shotgun (WGS) data and
data from two rounds of automated, directed read selection, which improved
the sequence quality and narrowed or (in some cases) closed gaps.
The raw WGS assembly data consists of 8,362 supercontigs larger than 1 kb, 
with a total size of approximately 161 Mb and an N50 length of about 2.5 Mb. 
The total number of contigs greater than 1 kb is 11,806, with a total size of
approximately 161 Mb and an N50 length of 119 kb. </P>
<P>
The data were
intially assembled using the whole-genome assembly program, PCAP 
(<A HREF="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/9/2164.long"
TARGET=_BLANK>Huang, <em>et al.</em>, 2003</A>).
To create chromosomal assignments and ordering along the
chromosomes, WUSTL first identified regions of the <em>D. yakuba</em> assembly
that uniquely aligned with the <em>D. melanogaster</em> genome. The <em>D. 
yakuba</em> contigs were initially ordered by their position along the
assigned <em>D. melanogaster</em> chromosomes (or segments for the
heterochromatin). Alignment of all <em>D. melanogaster</em> mRNAs against the
<em>D. yakuba</em> assembly were used to confirm these DNA-based alignments.
WUSTL then introduced the inversions indicated by the <em>D. yakuba</em> sequence
assembly to create the <em>D. yakuba</em> chromosomal files. The number of
inversions required and the resulting banding patterns are in good
agreement with the expected number and patterns, based on polytene
chromosome banding data from

The sequence is distributed among the following chromosomes: 2L, 2R, 
2h, 3L, 3R, 3h, 4, X, Xh, Yh, M (mitochondria) and U. Sequence that
could not be reliably ordered within a chromosome <em>N</em> has been placed on
chr<em>N</em>_random. Heterochromatin that has been localized to a specific
chromosome can be found in chr<em>N</em>h or Chr<em>N</em>h_random. </P>
