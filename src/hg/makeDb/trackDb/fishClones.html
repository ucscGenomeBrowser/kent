<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the location of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) mapped clones along the 
draft assembly sequence.  The locations of these clones were
contributed as a part of The BAC Resource Consortium's paper &quot;<A

Integration of cytogenetic landmarks into the draft sequence of the
human genome</A>&quot;, <I>Nature</I> 409:953-958, Feb. 2001.</P>

<P> More information about the BAC clones, including how they can be
obtained, can be found at the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/cyto/hbrc.shtml" TARGET=_blank>Human BAC Resource</A>
and the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/clone/index.html" TARGET=_blank>Clone Registry</A>
web sites hosted by <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" TARGET=_blank>NCBI</A>.
To view Clone Registry information for a clone, click on the clone name at the top of the details page for that item.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude the display of a dataset from  an individual lab. This is helpful when many items are shown in the track
display, especially when only some are relevant to the current task. To use the
filter:
<UL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the lab whose data you would like to highlight or exclude in the display. 
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not
display clones from the lab selected in the pulldown list. If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser
will display clones only from the selected lab.
</UL></P>
<P>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.</P>
