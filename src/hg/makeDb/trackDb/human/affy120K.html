<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows locations of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
on the Affymetrix 120K SNP Genotyping Array.  The SNPs in this track
include all of the markers from the array that have been successfully
mapped against the current assembly.</P>

<P>The SNPs were selected from public domain databases or the Perlegen
SNP database. Genotypes for these markers were generated at Affymetrix
using GeneChip(r) DNA analysis technology.</P>

<P>During sample preparation, an <B>enzyme</B> is used to fragment the
genomic DNA into smaller pieces.  The restriction endonucleases
<I><B>HindIII</B></I> and <I><B>XbaI</B></I> have been used to generate this
data.</P>

<P>Genotypes are reported as pairs of basecalls representing the two
observed alleles.  Individual genotypes for which no call was made are
labeled 'NC'.  A minimum of 46 genotype calls in the set of 54
individuals are included for each SNP.</P>

<P><B>Allele Frequency</B> for the 'A' allele is two times the number
of 'AA' calls plus the number of 'AB' calls, divided by two times the
total number of calls.  Allele Frequency for the 'B' allele is two
times the number of 'BB' calls plus the number of 'AB' calls, divided
by two times the total number of calls.  The <B>Minimum Allele
Frequency</B> is the lesser of these two values.
<B>Heterozygosity</B> is two times the product of the two allele
frequencies.</P>
