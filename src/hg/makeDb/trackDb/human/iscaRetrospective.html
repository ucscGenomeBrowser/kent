 <B>While the ISCA data are
 open to the public, users seeking information about a personal medical or
 genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
 diagnosis and for answers to personal medical questions.
 </P>
 
 <P>UCSC presents these data for use by qualified professionals, and even
 such professionals should use caution in interpreting the significance of 
 information found here.  No single data point should be taken at face 
 value and such data should always be used in conjunction with as much 
 corroborating data as possible.  No treatment protocols should be 
 developed or patient advice given on the basis of these data without 
 careful consideration of all possible sources of information.
 </P>

 <P>No attempt to identify individual patients should
 be undertaken.  No one is authorized to attempt to identify patients 
 by any means.

The <A HREF = "http://iscaconsortium.org" TARGET = _BLANK>International 
Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays</A> (ISCA) Consortium is 
group of clinical cytogenetics and molecular genetics laboratories 
that has been organized to improve the quality of patient care in clinical 
genetic testing using new molecular cytogenetic technologies. 
These technologies include array comparative genomic hybridization 
(aCGH) and quantitative SNP analysis by microarrays or bead chips.
Membership in the ISCA Consortium is open to all individuals and 
laboratories involved in cytogenetic array testing who are committed 
to free data sharing and to participation in a process to develop 
evidence-based standards and guidelines to improve patient care.
</P>

<P>  
The ISCA retrospective dataset 
displays microarray data submitted to dbGaP by cytogenetics labs 
of the ISCA Consortium, showing genomic regions 
found in patient who were referred for genetic testing for disorders 
such as mental retardation, developmental 
delay, autism and gross congenital malformation.  

<P>Some of the deletions and duplications reported in this track have been
identified as causative for the phenotype by clinical cytogeneticists at 
those locations, and to the best of their knowledge represent the cause 
of the reported phenotype.  It should be noted that phenotype information
is often vague and imprecise and should be used with caution.  While all 
samples were submitted because of a phenotype in a patient, only 15% of
patients had variants determined to be causal.
</P>

<P>  Many samples have multiple variants, not all of which are causative 
of the phenotype.  The retrospective dataset was obtained
from patients who were not asked for consent for release of their genetic 
information into a public database.  To protect their privacy, the 
chromosome imbalances in these samples have been decoupled so it is not
possible to connect multiple imbalances as coming from a single patient.
It is therefore not possible to identify individuals via their genotype.  
</P>


<H2>Methods and Color Convention</H2>
<P>
The samples were analyzed by oligo array CGH microarray from patients referred for 
cytogeneic testing due to clinical phenotypes.  Samples were analyzed on a 
variety of microarray platforms, with a resolution of 20-75 kb, using pooled
reference samples as control.  Several consecutive probes were required
before a region was determined to be either amplified or deleted.
Where available, deletion endpoint uncertainty is described on the details page 
for each sample, but is not shown graphically on the Browser image..
</P>

<P>Data were submitted to 
<A HREF = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000205.v2.p1"
TARGET = _BLANK>dbGaP</A> at NCBI and thence decoupled as described into 
<A HREF = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/studies/nstd37/" 
TARGET = _BLANK>dbVar</A> for unrestricted release. 
</P>

<P>
The entries are colored <B><FONT COLOR = RED>red for deletions</FONT></B>  and 
<B><FONT COLOR = BLUE>blue for duplications</FONT></B>. 
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Data were validated using a number of different methods, including
variously, BAC aCGH, FISH, Karyotype and  RT-PCR.
