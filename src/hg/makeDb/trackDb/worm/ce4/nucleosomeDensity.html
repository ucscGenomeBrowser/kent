<H3>Coverage of mononucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads</H3>
Coverage of monucleonucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads
The plot represents the coverage by putative mononucleosomal cores 
(147 bps) from Micrococcal nuclease cleavage of C. elegans chromatin, 
using reads that mapped on the sense strand of the reference genome
4.Coverage of monucleonucleosomal fragments, antisense strand reads
The plot represents the coverage by putative mononucleosomal cores 
(147 bps) from  Micrococcal nuclease cleavage of C. elegans chromatin 
using reads that mapped on the antisense strand of the reference 
genome
