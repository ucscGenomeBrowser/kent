<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE Genes track (version M38, September 2025) shows high-quality manual
annotations merged with evidence-based automated annotations across the entire
human genome generated by the
<a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/" target="_blank">GENCODE project</a>.
By default, only the basic gene set is
displayed, which is a subset of the comprehensive gene set. The basic set represents transcripts
that GENCODE believes will be useful to the majority of users.</p>

<p>
The track includes protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and pseudo-genes, though pseudo-genes
are not displayed by default. It contains annotations on the reference chromosomes as well as
assembly patches and alternative loci (haplotypes).</p>

<p>
The VM38 release was derived from the GTF file that contains annotations only on the main
chromosomes. Statistics for this build and information on how they were generated can be found on
the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/stats_M38.html">GENCODE site</a>.

</p>

<p>
For more information on the different gene tracks, see our <a target="_blank"
href="/FAQ/FAQgenes.html">Genes FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, this track displays only the basic GENCODE set, splice variants, and non-coding genes.
It includes options to display the entire GENCODE set and pseudogenes. To customize these
options, the respective boxes can be checked or unchecked at the top of this description page. 

<p>
This track also includes a variety of labels which identify the transcripts when visibility is set
to &quot;full&quot; or &quot;pack&quot;. Gene symbols (e.g. NIPA1) are displayed by default, but
additional options include GENCODE Transcript ID (ENSMUST00000052204.6), UCSC Known Gene ID
(uc009hdu.3), UniProt Display ID (Q8BHK1). Additional information about gene
and transcript names can be found in our
<a target="_blank" href="/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#genename">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>
This track, in general, follows the display conventions for <a target="_blank"
href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction tracks</a>. The exons for
putative non-coding genes and untranslated regions are represented by relatively thin blocks, while
those for coding open reading frames are thicker. 
<p><b>Coloring</b> for the gene annotations is based on the annotation type: </p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#0c0c78"><b>coding</b></font>
  <li><font color="#006400"><b>non-coding</b></font>
  <li><font color="#ff33ff"><b>pseudogene</b></font>
  <li><font color="#fe0000"><b>problem</b></font>
  <li><font color="#ff33ff"><b>all 2-way pseudogenes</b></font>
  <li><font color="#000000"><b>all polyA annotations</b></font>
</ul>

<p>
This track contains an optional <a target="_blank"
href="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">codon coloring feature</a> that allows users to
quickly validate and compare gene predictions. There is also an option to display the data as
a <a target="_blank" href="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">density graph</a>, which
can be helpful for visualizing the distribution of items over a region.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE VM38 track was built from the <a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/" 
target="_blank">GENCODE downloads</a> comprehensive gene annotation (all regions) file 
<code>gencode.vM38.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gff3.gz</code>. Data from other sources 
were correlated with the GENCODE data to build association tables.</p>

<h2>Related Data</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE Genes transcripts are annotated in numerous tables, each of which is also available as a
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm39/database/" target="_blank">downloadable
file</a>.

<p>
One can see a full list of the associated tables in the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgTables"
target="_blank">Table Browser</a> by selecting GENCODE Genes from the <b>track</b> menu; this list
is then available on the <b>table</b> menu.
</ul>

<h2>Data access</h2>
<p>
GENCODE Genes and its associated tables can be explored interactively using the
<a href="../goldenPath/help/api.html" target="_blank">REST API</a>, the
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgTables" target="_blank">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgIntegrator" target="_blank">Data Integrator</a>. 
The genePred format files for mm39 are available from our 
<a target="_blank" href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm39/database/">
downloads directory</a> or in our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm39/bigZips/genes/" target="_blank">
GTF download directory</a>. 
All the tables can also be queried directly from our public MySQL
servers, with more information available on our
<a target="_blank" href="/goldenPath/help/mysql.html">help page</a> as well as on
<a target="_blank" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/blog/tag/mysql/">our blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE Genes track was produced at UCSC from the GENCODE comprehensive gene set using a
computational pipeline developed by Jim Kent and Brian Raney.  This version of the track
was generated by Jonathan Casper.</p>
