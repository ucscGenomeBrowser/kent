<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
Using RNA-seq (Mortazavi <EM>et al.</EM>, 2008), high-resolution
genome-wide maps of the mouse transcriptome in various mouse (C57BL/6) 
tissues, primary cells, cell lines of different developmental stage and age groups were generated.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>
This is a composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring composite
tracks are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
This track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based
on processed data.</DD>
<DT><I>Alignments</I></DT><DD>Mappings of short reads to the genome. See the <A HREF="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf" TARGET="_BLANK">SAM Format Specification</A> for more information on the SAM/BAM file format.</DD>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse" target="_blank">ENCODE cell culture protocols</a>.
</P>

<P><DT><B><I>RNA-seq</I></B></DT>
RNA samples from tissues and primary cells were extracted
from Trizol&#174; according to protocol (Invitrogen). Long PolyA+ RNA
was purified with the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen).
The mRNA libraries were prepared for strand-specific sequencing as
described previously (Parkhomchuk <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009).
</P>


<P><DT><B><I>Sequencing and Analysis</I></B></DT>
Samples were sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer II,
Genome Analyzer IIx and HiSeq 2000 platforms
for 36 cycles.  Image analysis, base calling and 
alignment to the mouse genome version NCBI37/mm9 were performed 
using Illumina&#39;s RTA.
Alignment to the mouse genome was performed using
TopHat (Trapnell <EM>et al</EM>., 2009).  Wig files were 
generated by TopHat and expression levels were 
calculated with Cufflinks (Trapnell <EM>et al.</EM>, 2010).
