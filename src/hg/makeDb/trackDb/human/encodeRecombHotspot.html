<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of recombination hotspots detected from
patterns of genetic variation. It is based on the HapMap ENCODE data,
in the ten ENCODE regions that have been resequenced:
<UL>
<LI>ENr112 (chr2)
<LI>ENr131 (chr2)
<LI>ENr113 (chr4)
<LI>ENm010 (chr7)
<LI>ENm013 (chr7)
<LI>ENm014 (chr7)
<LI>ENr321 (chr8)
<LI>ENr232 (chr9)
<LI>ENr123 (chr12)
<LI>ENr213 (chr18)
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Observations from sperm studies (Jeffreys <em>et al</em>., 2001) and
patterns of genetic variation (McVean <em>et al</em>., 2004; Crawford
<em>et al</em>., 2004) show that recombination rates in the human
genome vary extensively over kilobase scales and that much
recombination occurs in recombination hotspots. This provides an
explanation for the apparent block-like structure of linkage
disequlibrium (Daly <em>et al</em>., 2001; Gabriel <em>et al</em>.,
2002).
</P>
<P>
Recombination hotspot estimates provide a new route to
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying human recombination.
A better understanding of the genomic landscape of human recombination
hotspots would facilitate the efficient design and analysis of
disease association studies and greatly improve inferences from
polymorphism data about selection and human demographic history.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Recombination hotspots are identified using the likelihood-ratio test
described in McVean <I>et al</I>. (2004) and Winckler <I>et al</I>. (2005), 
referred to as LDhot.  For successive intervals of 200 kb, the maximum
likelihood of a model with a constant recombination rate is compared
to the maximum likelihood of a model in which the central 2 kb is a
recombination hotspot (likelihoods are approximated by the composite
likelihood method of Hudson 2001).  The observed difference in log
composite likelihood is compared against the null distribution, which
is obtained by simulations.  Simulations are matched for sample size,
SNP density, background recombination rate and an approximation to the
ascertainment scheme (a panel of 12 individuals with a Poisson number
of chromosomes, mean 1, sampled from this panel, using a single hit
ascertainment scheme for dbSNP and resequencing of 16 individuals for
the 10 HapMap ENCODE regions).  Evidence for a hotspot was assessed in
each analysis panel separately (YRI, CEU and combined CHB+JPT), and
p-values were combined such that a hotspot requires that two of the
three populations show some evidence of a hotspot (p &lt; 0.05) and at
least one population showed stronger evidence for a hotspot
(p &lt; 0.01). Hotspot centers were estimated at those locations where
distinct recombination rate estimate peaks occurred with at least a factor 
of two separation between peaks, within the low p-value intervals.
</P>

<H2>Validation</H2>
<P>
This approach has been validated in three ways: by extensive
simulation studies and by comparisons with independent estimates of
recombination rates, both over large scales from the genetic map and
over fine scales from sperm analysis.  Full details of validation can be 
found in McVean <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Winckler <em>et al</em>. (2005).
