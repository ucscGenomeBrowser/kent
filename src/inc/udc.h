/* udc - url data cache - a caching system that keeps blocks of data fetched from URLs in
 * sparse local files for quick use the next time the data is needed. 
 *
 * This cache is enormously simplified by there being no local _write_ to the cache,
 * just reads.  
 *
 * The overall strategy of the implementation is to have a root cache directory
 * with a subdir for each file being cached.  The directory for a single cached file
 * contains two files - "bitmap" and "sparseData" that contains information on which
 * parts of the URL are cached and the actual cached data respectively. The subdirectory name
 * associated with the file is constructed from the URL in a straightforward manner.
 *     http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway
 * gets mapped to:
 *     rootCacheDir/http/genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway/
 * The URL protocol is the first directory under the root, and the remainder of the
 * URL, with some necessary escaping, is used to define the rest of the cache directory
 * structure, with each '/' after the protocol line translating into another directory
 * level.
 *    
 * The bitmap file contains time stamp and size data as well as an array with one bit
 * for each block of the file that has been fetched.  Currently the block size is 8K. */
