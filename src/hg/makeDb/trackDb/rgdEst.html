<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows expressed sequence tags (ESTs) downloaded from the
Rat Genome Database (RGD). An EST is a partial sequence of a randomly-chosen 
cDNA, obtained from the results of a single DNA sequencing reaction. ESTs 
are used to identify transcribed regions in genomic sequence and to 
characterize patterns of gene expression in the tissue from which the 
cDNA was derived.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The data used to create this annotation were obtained from the file 
<A HREF="ftp://rgd.mcw.edu/pub/RGD_genome_annotations/V3.1/GFF_files/" 
TARGET=_blank>RGD_EST.gff</A> downloaded from the RGD website.</P>
