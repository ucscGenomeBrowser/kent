<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows gene models reconstructed solely from
mRNA and EST evidence by Danielle and Jean Thierry-Mieg
and Vahan Simonyan using the <A HREF="http://www.acedb.org/Cornell/acembly/"
TARGET=_blank>Acembly</A> program.</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>Acembly attempts to find the best alignment of each mRNA against the 
genome, and considers alternative splice models. If more than one gene 
model is produced that has statistical significance, all of these models 
are displayed.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:mieg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">Jean Thierry-Mieg</A> at NIH for
