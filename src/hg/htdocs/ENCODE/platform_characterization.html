                            The ENCODE and modENCODE projects have collected thousands of datasets to identify functional 
                            elements, each consisting of at least two replicates.  Biochemical validation of every individual 
                            dataset is an impractical prospect.  As an alternative, the consortia are characterizing the platforms 
                            used to comprehensively identify these functional elements.  In some cases, this involves orthogonal testing 
                            of the platforms used to collect data to form catalogs of functional elements.  For ChIP datasets, comparisons 
                            of ChIP-seq to ChIP-chip have been performed, as well as analysis of detection of spiked-in standards.  For 
                            RNA-seq, examination of the behavior of spike-in standards has been performed.  In addition to the standard 
                            ENCODE antibody characterization efforts, a systematic analysis of histone antibodies has been performed.
                            Summaries to these individual studies and links to the publications are below.

			<p>Key platform characterization finding is that over a wide range, there is a linear correlation 
			between signal (read density) and RNA concentration (input) in RNA-seq experiments.  Another key 
			finding is excellent agreement between replicates.  A pool of RNA standards (96 different RNAs, 
			various lengths and GC content) spanning a million fold concentration range was used in this determination.
			Some bias was found with respect to GC content and fragment length; these biases were reproducible and protocol dependent.

			<p>Key platform characterization findings include ChIP-seq data are generally better than ChIP-chip 
			data with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, number of detected peaks and resolution. While there is 
			strong agreement between the two platforms, the peaks identified using these two platforms can be significantly 
			different, depending on the factor antibody and the analysis pipeline. Identification of binding regions is 
			dependent on the peak calling pipeline used, and more difficult for factors that are enriched in broad regions.  
			In addition, input DNA libraries used for ChIP-seq can vary, and high-quality input samples sequenced with 
			sufficient depth are important for accurate peak calling.

			<p>Histone modification antibodies were characterized for specificity by dot blot, immunoblot and ChIP.  
			More than 20&#37; of the tested antibodies failed in ChIP experiments. A website was developed for posting 
			results of the antibody characterization.

			<p>A number of microarray platforms were tested using a spike-in positive control approach, and found to provide results that 
			were consistent with each other.  Variance specific to microarray platform was similar or smaller than the variance associated with 
			laboratory, protocols and analysis pipeline.  Sensitivity was good even at relatively low spike-in levels.  Simple repeats and 
			segmental duplication caused false positive errors in peak detection.
