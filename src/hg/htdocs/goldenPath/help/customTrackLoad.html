<p>
An annotation data file in one of the supported custom track 
<a href="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#format" target="_blank">formats</a> may be uploaded by 
any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  (<em>Preferred</em>) Enter one or more <a href="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#ADD_CT"
  target="_blank">URLs</a> for custom tracks (one per line) in the data text box. The Genome Browser
  supports both the HTTP and FTP (passive-only) protocols.</li>
  <li>
  Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button directly above the URL/data text box, then choose a custom 
  track file from your local computer, or type the pathname of the file into the 
  &quot;upload&quot; text box adjacent to the &quot;Browse&quot; button. The custom track data may 
  be compressed by any of the following programs: gzip (<em>.gz</em>), compress (<em>.Z</em>), or 
  bzip2 (<em>.bz2</em>). Files containing compressed data must include the appropriate suffix in 
  their names.</li>
  <li>
  Paste the custom annotation text directly into the URL/data text box. Data provided by a URL may 
  need to be proceeded by a separate line defining 
  <a href="/goldenPath/help/customTrack.html#TRACK">type=<em>track_type</em></a> required for some 
  tracks, for example, &quot;track type=broadPeak&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
If a login and password is required to access data loaded through a URL, this information can be 
included in the URL using the format <em>protocol://user:password@server.com/somepath</em>. Only 
basic authentication is supported for HTTP. Note that passwords included in URLs are
<strong><em>not</em></strong> protected. If a password contains a non-alphanumeric character, such 
as &#36;, the character must be replaced by the hexidecimal representation for that character. For 
example, in the password <em>mypwd&#36;wk</em>, the &#36; character should be replaced by %24, 
resulting in the modified password <em>mypwd%24wk</em>.</p>
