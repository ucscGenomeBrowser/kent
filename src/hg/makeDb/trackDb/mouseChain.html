<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows mouse/$organism genomic alignments using
a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps than traditional
affine gap scoring systems.  It can also tolerate gaps
in both mouse and $organism simultaneously.  These &quot;double-sided&quot;
gaps can be caused by local inversions and overlapping deletions
in both species.</P>
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or 
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.  Single lines indicate 
gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the non-$organism assembly
or an insertion in the $organism assembly.
Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one 
species.  In cases where there are multiple 
chains over a particular portion of the $organism genome, chains with 
single-lined gaps often are due to processed pseudogenes, while chains 
with double-lined gaps are more often due to paralogs and non-prodessed 
pseudogenes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Transposons that have been inserted since the mouse/$organism
split were removed, and the resulting abbreviated genomes were
aligned with blastz. The transposons were then put back into the
alignments.  The resulting alignments were converted into axt format
and the resulting axts fed into axtChain.  AxtChain organizes all 
the alignments between a single mouse and a single $organism chromosome
into a group and creates a kd-tree from all the gapless subsections
(blocks) of the alignments.  Next, maximally scoring chains of these
blocks were found by running a dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains
scoring below a threshold were discarded; the remaining chains are
displayed here.</P>
