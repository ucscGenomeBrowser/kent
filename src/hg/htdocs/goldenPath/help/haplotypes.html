<p>
The Gene Haplotype Alleles feature displays the chromosome-phased
<a href='http://www.1000genomes.org/' target=_blank>1000 Genomes</a> Phase 1 data for protein
coding regions. These data comprise the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations in Africa,
Europe, East Asia and the Americas, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome
and exome sequencing.</p>
<p>
The variant genotypes have been phased by the 1000 Genomes Project (<em>i.e.</em>, the two alleles
of each diploid genotype have been assigned to two haplotypes, one inherited from each parent).</p>

<H2>How to use the &quot;Gene Haplotype Alleles&quot; section</H2>

<P> 
Click on any protein-coding gene in the UCSC Genes track and scroll to the <B>Common Gene 
Haplotype Alleles</B> section. (The feature is currently implemented only on GRCh37/hg19 
protein-coding genes.)  There will be a table of haplotypes for the protein-coding 
portion of the gene.  Each row in the table represents a unique gene haplotype as found in 
the 1000 Genomes Phase 1 project data.  The table is sortable on any column by clicking on 
the column headers.  <!-- Note that if the gene is on the negative ('-' or &quot;reverse&quot;) 
strand, all variant sites and sequences will be presented with respect to the negative strand. 
This differs from the way variants are displayed in the 1000 Genomes phase 1 variations track,
which are always shown as they appear on the positive ('+' or "forward") strand. --></P> 

<dl>
<dt><B class='textOpt'>Haplotype Frequency</b></dt>
<dd>Haplotype frequencies are based upon all releveant chromosomes in the data set.  The total
    number is almost always 2,184 (1,092 for Y and location-dependent for X).  Hover over
    the frequency calculations to show the number of a particular haplotype in the dataset 
    (<em>e.g.</em>, <span title='N=1327 of 2184'>"N=1327 of 2184"</span>).  
    If appropriate, the homozygous frequency will also be shown and will reflect the number 
    of individuals in the dataset.
    <BR><BR>

    The <em>reference haplotype</em> (made of entirely reference variants) may 
    not be represented in the 1000 Genomes data.  If it is, it will be so marked in the 
    &quot;<B>Ref</B>&quot; column.

    are represented by <b>&quot;]&quot;</b> and predicted frameshifts by
    <b>&quot;[>>]&quot;</b>.</p>
    <p>
    The <em>reference variant</em> is shown at the top of each variant site column. This is the
    value found in the GRCh37/hg19 reference genome at that variant site. In most cases it is a
    single letter (AA code/DNA base). In the case of an insertion with respect to the reference
    genome, the reference value is shown as <b>&quot;-&quot;</b>. Large deletions are represented
    by the first two sequence letters followed by <b>&quot;+++&quot;</b>.</p>
    <p>
    Hovering the pointer over any of the variant site links will show a more complete description
    of that variant. For example, the variant description
    <b><span title='AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063'>
                "AA:16 A|T chr9:136137554 SNP: G|A (0.995|0.005) rs55917063"</span></b>

<span class='textAlert'>Scores alone cannot be used to draw definitive conclusions about 
any haplotype.</span>
<dl>
<dt><B class='textOpt'>Hap score</B></dt>
<dd>The <B>haplotype score</B> is based on the normalized (-log<sub>10</sub>) probability of 
    finding exactly N subject chromosomes with this haplotype, given the frequencies of individual 
    variants and assuming they are independent.  The score is normalized by multiplying the base 
    probability by the total number of variants.  Normalization allows comparing the scores 
    between genes with many variant sites and those with few.  The score will be positive if the 
    haplotype is more frequent than expected by chance and negative if less frequent.  Larger 
    scores will result when minor variant alleles occur together more frequently 
    than expected, which might reflect co-selection or may merely be an artifact of more 
    recent events.  A negative haplotype score may be more informative. 
    For haplotypes made from common, non-synonymous variants, haplotype scores above 606 
    are seen in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -199 is only seen 
    in 2&#37; of genes.<BR><BR></dd>

    exactly N individuals with this haplotype on both chromosomes, given the <em>actual</em> 
    frequency of the haplotype in subject chromosomes. The score will be positive if the 
    haplotype is found homozygous in more individuals than expected and negative when found 
    in fewer than expected.  Negative values might suggest that the haplotype is deleterious 
    when homozygous.  For haplotypes made from common, non-synonymous variants, homozygous 
    scores above 92 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes.  Likewise, a score of less than -15 is 
    only seen in 2&#37; of genes.<BR><BR></dd> 

<dt><B class='textOpt'>Pop score</B></dt>
<dd>The <B>population score</B> (only visible when population distributions are displayed)
    is the fixation index (F<sub>ST</sub>) based upon the difference in variance between
    sub-population haplotype frequencies and the total haplotype frequency.  Note that
    this calculation is based upon the frequency of haplotype, rather than the distribution of
    that haplotype across populations.  Nevertheless, large population scores should reflect
    large skews in distribution in more frequently occurring haplotypes.
    For haplotypes made from common, non-synonymous variants,
    population scores above 0.424 are seen in only 2&#37; of genes and scores above 0.506 are
