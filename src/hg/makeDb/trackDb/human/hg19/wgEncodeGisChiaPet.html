<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track was produced as part of the ENCODE Project. 
 A chromatin interaction is
defined as the association of two regions of the genome that are 
far apart in terms of genomic distance, but are
spatially proximate to each other in 
the 3-dimensional cellular nucleus.
Chromatin Interaction Analysis with Paired-End
Tag (ChIA-PET) (Fullwood et al., 2010) shows the locations of 
chromatin interactions determined by paired-end tag 
sequencing using proximity-ligated
chromatin extracts from five different human cancer cell lines: 
K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia), 
HCT-116 (colorectal cancer), 
HeLa-S3 (cervical cancer), 
MCF-7 (breast cancer),  
and NB4 (promyelocytic).
<P>
Additionally, ChIA-PET experiments generate 
transcription factor binding sites. A binding site
is defined as a region of the genome 
that is highly enriched by specific Chromatin
ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) against a transcription 
factor, which indicates that the transcription
factor binds specifically to this region. 
Generally, a chromatin interaction is more likely to
connect two transcription factor binding sites together.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
In the graphical display, the tags (ends) are 
represented by blocks, and connected by a horizontal
line if both ends are in the same chromosome 
and in a viewable window. PET sequences that
overlap at both ends form PET clusters and the 
total count of PETs in a PET cluster reflects
the strength of a chromatin interaction. 
Singleton PETs (PET count = 1) are
potentially false positives, whereas PET clusters with 
PET count 3 and above could indicate genuine
chromatin interactions. A density track of the 
tags shows the ChIP enrichment at different points
of genome, and high peaks indicate transcription
factor binding sites.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag 
sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a global de novo
 high-throughput method for characterizing the 3-dimensional
structure of chromatin in the nucleus. In the 
ChIA-PET protocol, cells were cross-linked and
fragmented followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. 
The DNA fragments that were brought together 
by the chromatin interactions are then 
proximity-ligated. During this proximity
ligation step, the half-linkers containing flanking 
MmeI sites (type IIS restriction enzymes) were
first ligated to the DNA fragments and then
ligated to each other to form full
linkers. Full linkers bridge either two ends of a 
self-circularized fragment, or two ends of two
different chromatin fragments. The material was 
then reverse cross-linked, purified and digested
with MmeI. As MmeI cuts 20 base pairs away from its 
recognition site, tag-linker-tag (paired-end
 tag, PET) constructs were obtained, which is 
then sequenced by ultra-high-throughput
methods (Illumina or SOLiD paired-end sequencing). 
ChIA-PET reads were processed with
 the ChIA-PET Tool (Li et al., 2010)
by the following steps: linker filtering, 
short reads mapping, PET classification, binding site 
identification, and interaction cluster identification. 
The high-confidence binding sites and 
chromatin interaction clusters were reported.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Chromatin interactions identified by ChIA-PET have been 
validated by 3C, ChIP-3C, 4C and DNA-FISH (Fullwood et al., 2009).
