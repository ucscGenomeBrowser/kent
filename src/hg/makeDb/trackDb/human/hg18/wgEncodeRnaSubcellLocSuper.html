<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks were produced as part of the <a
 href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> Transcriptome
Project. They compare RNA levels in different sub-cellular
localizations and cell lines, as measured by a diverse set of
technologies.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
These tracks are multi-view composite tracks that contains multiple
data types (views). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.&nbsp; Each view within each track
has separate display controls, as described <a
href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
Each view represents RNA abundance within the indicated subcellular
compartments.&nbsp; Specific aspects of the views vary by track. <br>
<h2>Credits<br>
</h2>
These data were generated and analyzed as part of the <a
 href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">ENCODE</a> project, a
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all
functional elements in the human genome.&nbsp; This effort includes
collecting a variety of data over a specific set of <a
href="/ENCODE/cellTypes.html">cell types</a>.&nbsp;
Consequently,
data related to these tracks be available under ENCODE
tracks. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>Data Release Policy</h2>
Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset
until nine months following the release of the dataset. This date is
listed in the Restricted Until column on the track configuration page
and the download page. The full data release policy for ENCODE is
available <a href="/ENCODE/terms.html">here</a>.<br>
