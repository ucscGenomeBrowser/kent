<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows protein sequence annotations from the <a
href="http://www.uniprot.org/" target="_blank">UniProt/SwissProt</A> database,
mapped to genomic coordinates.
The data has been curated from scientific publications by the UniProt staff.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Genomic locations of UniProt/SwissProt annotations are labeled with a short name
for the type of annotation (e.g. "glyco", "disul", "signal pep" etc.). A click
on them shows the full annotation and provides a link to the UniProt/SwissProt
record for all details.  </p>

<p>
Mouse over a mutation to see the UniProt comments.
</p>

<p>
Modified residues are highlighted in light blue, transmembrane regions in blue,
glycosylation sites in yellow, disulfide bonds in grey, topological domains in
red.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UniProt sequences were aligned to RefSeq sequences first with BLAT, then lifted
to genome positions with pslMap.  UniProt variants were parsed from the UniProt
XML file.  The variants were then mapped to the genome through the alignment
using the pslMap program.  This mapping approach
draws heavily on the <A HREF="http://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu/LS-SNP/"
TARGET="_BLANK">LS-SNP</A> pipeline by Mark Diekhans. The complete script is
part of the kent source tree and is located in src/hg/utils/uniprotMutations.
