overlapSelect [options] selectFile inFile outFile

Select records based on overlapping chromosome ranges.  The ranges are
specified in the selectFile, with each block specifying a range.
Records are copied from the inFile to outFile based on the selection
criteria.  Selection is based on blocks or exons rather than entire
range.

Options starting with -select* apply to selectFile and those starting
with -in* apply to inFile.

Options:
  -selectFmt=fmt - specify selectFile format:
          psl - PSL format (default for *.psl files).
          pslq - PSL format, using query instead of target
          genePred - genePred format (default for *.gp or
                     *.genePred files).
          bed - BED format (default for *.bed files).
                If BED doesn't have blocks, the bed range is used. 
          chain - chain file format (default from .chain files)
          chainq - chain file format, using query instead of target
  -selectCoordCols=spec - selectFile is tab-separate with coordinates
       as described by spec, which is one of:
            o chromCol - chrom in this column followed by start and end.
            o chromCol,startCol,endCol - chrom, start, and end in specified
              columns.
            o chromCol,startCol,endCol,strandCol - chrom, start, end, and
              strand in specified columns.
          NOTE: column numbers are zero-based
  -selectCds - Use only CDS in the selectFile
  -selectRange - Use entire range instead of blocks from records in
          the selectFile.
  -inFmt=fmt - specify inFile format, same values as -selectFmt.
  -inCoordCols=spec - inFile is tab-separate with coordinates specified by
      spec, in format described above.
  -inCds - Use only CDS in the inFile
  -inRange - Use entire range instead of blocks of records in the inFile.
  -nonOverlapping - select non-overlapping instead of overlapping records
  -strand - must be on the same strand to be considered overlapping
  -oppositeStrand - must be on the opposite strand to be considered overlapping
  -excludeSelf - don't compare records with the same coordinates and name.
      Warning: using only one of -inCds or -selectCds will result in different
      coordinates for the same record.
  -idMatch - only select overlapping records if they have the same id
  -aggregate - instead of computing overlap bases on individual select entries, 
      compute it based on the total number of inFile bases overlap by selectFile
      records. -overlapSimilarity and -mergeOutput will not work with
      this option.
  -overlapThreshold=0.0 - minimum fraction of an inFile record that
      must be overlapped by a single select record to be considered
      overlapping.  Note that this is only coverage by a single select
      record, not total coverage.
  -overlapThresholdCeil=1.1 - select only inFile records with less than
      this amount of overlap with a single record.
  -overlapSimilarity=0.0 - minimum fraction of inFile and select records that
      Note that this is only coverage by a single select record and this
      is; bidirectional inFile and selectFile must overlap by this
      amount.  A value of 1.0 will select identical records (or CDS if
      both CDS options are specified.  Not currently supported with
      -aggregate.
  -overlapSimilarityCeil=1.1 - select only inFile records with less than
      this amount of similarity with a single record.
  -overlapBases=-1 - minimum number of bases of overlap, < 0 disables.
  -statsOutput - output overlap statistics instead of selected records. 
      If no overlap criteria is specified, all overlapping entries are
      reported, Otherwise only the pairs passing the criteria are
      reported. This results in a tab-separated file with the columns:
         inId selectId inOverlap selectOverlap overBases
      Where inOverlap is the fraction of the inFile record overlapped by
      the selectFile record and selectOverlap is the fraction of the
      select record overlap by inFile records.  With -aggregate, output
      is:
         inId inOverlap inOverBases inBases
  -statsOutputAll - like -statsOutput, however output all inFile records,
      including those that are not overlapped.
  -statsOutputBoth - like -statsOutput, however output all selectFile and
      inFile records, including those that are not overlapped.
  -mergeOutput - output file with be a merge of the input file with the
      selectFile records that selected it.  The format is
         inRec<tab>selectRec.
      if multiple select records hit, inRec is repeated. This will increase
      the memory required. Not supported with -nonOverlapping or -aggregate.
  -idOutput - output a tab-separated file of pairs of
         inId selectId
      with -aggregate, only a single column of inId is written
  -dropped=file  - output rows that were dropped to this file.
  -verbose=n - verbose > 1 prints some details,
