<h2>What is Genome Browser in a Box?</h2>
<p>
Genome Browser in a Box (GBiB) is a &quot;virtual machine&quot; of the entire UCSC Genome Browser 
website that is designed to run on most PCs (Windows, Mac OSX or Linux). GBiB allows you to access 
much of the UCSC Genome Browser's functionality from the comfort of your own computer. It is 
particularly directed at individuals who want to use the Genome Browser toolset to view protected 
data. If it is not human sequencing reads, it usually does not fall under
medical data privacy rules, and you should most likely not use GBiB but rather 
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hubQuickStartAssembly.html">assembly hubs</a> 
or <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html">track hubs</a>. 
See our <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/mirror.html#considerations-before-installing-a-genome-browser">mirror page</a> 
for adiscussion of the advantages/disadvantages of the different methods to
customize your genome data display.</p>

<h3>Differences between GBiB and the Genome Browser</h3>
<p>
While GBiB and the Genome Browser are similar in many ways, there are key differences. In 
particular, GBiB makes it much easier to visualize sensitive or protected data. Prior to the 
introduction of GBiB, it was necessary to upload your data to the UCSC Genome Browser website or 
place the data files on a publicly accessible web server and supply the URL to UCSC in order to view
your own data with the Genome Browser. GBiB removes these requirements: none of your data must be 
uploaded to the UCSC servers, allowing you to use the Genome Browser on personal datasets in 
situations where it's infeasible to load the data onto a public web server.</p>
<p>
Rather than installing the entire UCSC genome annotation database (several terabytes of data), GBiB 
instead depends upon remote connections to various UCSC servers for much of its functionality and 
data. It connects to the UCSC <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html" 
target="_blank">download server</a> to obtain genomic sequences, liftOver files, and many of the 
other large data files, and connects to one of UCSC's <a href="mysql.html">public MariaDB servers</a>
to download data displayed by the various annotation tracks. A few Genome Browser tracks are
unavailable on the UCSC public MariaDB servers due to agreements with the data distributors (DECIPHER
and LOVD Variants), and thus are unavailable for use with GBiB.</p>
<p>
The majority of protected data use in the research community currently focuses on the human genomes,
primarily the hg19 (GRCh37) assembly and with a growing body of annotation on the newer hg38 
(GRCh38) assembly. As a result, GBiB is currently optimized for use with the hg19 assembly. Many 
other recent genome assemblies can also be viewed, but access may be slower than for optimized 
assemblies. Access speed may also be impacted by your connection distance from the UCSC server. To 
improve performance in these situations, GBiB includes a simple tool that allows you to download 
(&quot;mirror&quot;) selected genome annotation tracks to your machine. You can find more 
information about this tool in the <a href="#GbibMirroring">Improving Speed and Performance</a> 
section.</p>

<a name="GetStarted"></a>
<h2>Getting Started: Setting up Genome Browser in a Box</h2>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<p>
GBiB will run on most modern PCs and major operating systems that meet these basic requirements: 
<ul>
  <li>
  The computer must support virtualization (common for most PCs sold after 2010).</li>
  <li>
  A compatible version of the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> 
  software (version 4.3.6 or higher) must be installed. This software is free to use in many 
  situations. See the VirtualBox wiki for <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ" 
  target="_blank">licensing terms and conditions</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">installation</a> instructions.
  You must have administrator privileges to install VirtualBox on your computer.</li>
  <li>
  The computer hard disk must have at least 20 GB of free space (more if you plan to mirror many 
  tracks).</li>
  <li>
  Your network firewall must allow outgoing connections to the following servers and ports:
  <ul>
    <li>MariaDB connections, used to load tracks not local to your computer:
      <ul>
        <li>US server: Port 3306 on genome-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu (128.114.119.174)</li>
        <li>European server: Port 3306 on genome-euro-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu (129.70.40.120)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Rsync, used to download track data:
      <ul>
        <li>US server: TCP port 873 on hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu (128.114.119.163)</li>
        <li>European server: TCP port 873 on hgdownload-euro.soe.ucsc.edu (129.70.40.99)</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Download HTML descriptions on the fly:
      <ul>
        <li>US server: TCP port 80 on hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu (128.114.119.163)</li>
        <li>European server: TCP port 80 on hgdownload-euro.soe.ucsc.edu (129.70.40.99)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
  Confirm that your system meets the above requirements.</li>
  <li>
  Download GBiB from the <a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Genome Browser 
  store</a>
  (see <a href="#License">Licensing Information</a>). Due to the large size of the <em>gbib.zip</em>
  product file, the download time may range from 30 minutes to a few hours depending on your 
  Internet connection speed and distance from UCSC.</li>
  <li>
  Extract the contents of the <em>gbib.zip</em> file (three files). If desired, the extracted files 
  can be moved to a different directory on your computer, as long as all three files reside in the 
  same directory and are not renamed. <strong>Extraction notes:</strong> On OSX, do not use the command line 
  tool &quot;unzip&quot; to extract the files; instead double-click on the <em>gbib.zip</em> file in
  the Finder window.  On Windows, you must use a third-party tool such as 
  <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" 
  target="_blank">WinRAR</a> to extract the <em>gbib.zip</em> contents, as the file size exceeds the
  capabilities of the standard Windows extraction tool.</li>
  <li>
  Add GBiB to VirtualBox:
  <ul>
    <li>
    Double-click on the <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file  extracted from <em>gbib.zip</em>
    <strong>OR</strong></li> 
    <li>
    Start VirtualBox, select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em>, and open the file 
    <em>browserbox.vbox</em>.<br>
    <img src="../../images/gbib-add.png" alt="Adding GBiB to VirtualBox" width="570" 
    height="162"><br></li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>
<p>
If VirtualBox or the Genome Browser displays an error message during the installation process, 
consult the <a href="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section.</p>

<a name="UsingGbib"></a>
<h2>Starting and using Genome Browser in a Box</h2>
<h3>Starting GBiB</h3>
<p>
To start using GBiB with VirtualBox:
<ol>
  <li>
  Start VirtualBox.</li>
  <li>
  Select &quot;browserbox&quot; on the VirtualBox left-hand menu (see "<a href="#GetStarted">Getting
  Started</a>" to add GBiB to VirtualBox).</li> 
  <li>
  Click the &quot;Start&quot; button in the VirtualBox toolbar.<br>
  <img src="../../images/gbib-start.png" alt="VirtualBox manager start" width="687" 
  height="364"></br><br> 
  This will open a black GBiB terminal window with a Linux command line interface:<br>
  <img src="../../images/gbib-terminal.png" alt="GBiB terminal window" width="627" height="478"><br>
  <br> 
  In most cases, GBiB will auto-update itself after starting for the first time. This update will 
  often include database tables for RefSeq Genes and other tables that are frequently updated at 
  UCSC. The auto-update may take several minutes to complete and the progress will be shown in the 
  terminal window.</li>
  <li>
  Open an Internet browser window to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234" 
  target="_blank">127.0.0.1:1234</a>. We recommend using this URL instead of http://localhost:1234, 
  because most Internet browsers do not send cookies to &quot;http://localhost&quot;, which are 
  required to save your browser configuration between sessions. You may want to bookmark 
  127.0.0.1:1234 for quick future access.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you have correctly set up GBiB, your Internet browser should display the Genome Browser home 
page. From this page, you can start using GBiB as you would the public Genome Browser website. 
Consult the UCSC Genome Browser <a href="hgTracksHelp.html">User's Guide</a> for introductory 
information on using the Genome Browser tools.</p>

<a name="GbibStop"></a>
<h3>Stopping GBiB</h3>
<p>
To shut down the GBiB machine (for example, to change configuration options):
<ol>
  <li>
  Close the GBiB terminal window.</li>
  <li>
  Select &quot;Send the shutdown signal&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</br>
  <img src="../../images/gbib-powerOff.png" alt="GBiB power off" width="526" height="244"></li>
</ol>

<a name="GbibMirroring"></a>
<h2>Improving speed and performance</h2>
<p>
Under certain circumstances the speed and response time of GBiB may be less than optimal. This 
section offers suggestions for improving the performance of your GBiB installation.</p>

<h3>Increasing GBiB RAM</h3>
<p>
As a first measure for performance improvement, try increasing the amount of RAM that GBiB is 
allowed to use. By default, this limit is set to 1 GB (1024 MB). If your machine has enough RAM 
installed, you may want to increase the GBiB RAM to 2, 4, or even 8 GB. This will usually improve 
the system responsiveness. To increase the RAM limit: 
<ol>
  <li>
  Shut down the GBiB machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping GBiB</a>).</li>
  <li>
  On the VirtualBox Manager window, click <em>Settings &gt;&gt; System</em>.</li>
  <li>
  Move the memory slider to the value of your choice, then click &quot;OK&quot;.<br>
  <img src="../../images/gbib-RAM.png" alt="GBiB RAM" width="579" height="490"></li>
</ol>

<h3>Using the GBiB mirror tool</h3>
<p>
If your GBiB performance is still slow after increasing the RAM, you may be located too far from 
UCSC. The load time of default tracks ranges from a few seconds on the west coast of the United 
States to as much as 7 seconds from Europe. In this situation, you may want to use the GBiB mirror 
tool to download (&quot;mirror&quot;) tracks to your machine, which will greatly increase the access
speed for those tracks.</p>
<p>
To use the mirror tool: 
<ol>
  <li>
  Click <em>Tools &gt;&gt; Mirror Tracks</em> in the Genome Browser menu. The first time you open 
  the mirror tool, this page may take a while to load.</li>
  <li>
  Select the tracks that you typically use by checking the boxes next to the track names.</li>
  <li>
  Click <em>Download</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In addition to downloading entire track sets, you can also download individual subtracks. The file 
size of each track is listed next to the track name. If you are unsure of which tracks to select, 
we recommend the option <em>Default tracks with conservation tables, but no alignments</em>. When 
downloading large tracks, keep in mind that you cannot delete these tracks and the related data from
GBiB once you have downloaded them. If you find that you've started downloading the wrong track or a
track that is too large for your machine, you can cancel the download at any point by clicking 
<em>Cancel Download Now</em>.</p>
<p>
Depending on your network bandwidth, the download can take several minutes or up to a few hours over
a DSL line. <strong>During the download</strong>, the file <em>gbib-data.vdi</em> will grow in size,
and <strong>you will not be able to use GBiB</strong>. Once the download is complete, the default 
tracks should load in less than three seconds for a typical genomic position.</p>
<p>
If you are in your GBiB on the command-line you can use a direct rsync command for files of
interest. For example, if you knew you wanted all the GENCODE tracks on hg19 you could run either
of the two rsync commands for the North American or European hgdownload servers:
<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::mysql/hg19/wgEncodeGencode* /data/mysql/hg19/.</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload-euro.soe.ucsc.edu::mysql/hg19/wgEncodeGencode* /data/mysql/hg19/.</code>
</pre>
<p>
The above commands will rsync all of the files at the UCSC hgdownload server in the hg19 assembly
that start with wgEncodeGencode to your GBiB into the hg19 directory. There are some supporting
files in a hgFixed directory, such as for the publication tracks, that could be mirrored with such
commands.</p>
<p>
Here is another example for hg38 where the following commands would download all the supporting
encRegTfbs and factorbook tables for the Transcription Factor ChIP-seq Clusters track:
<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::mysql/hg38/encRegTfbs* /data/mysql/hg38/.</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::mysql/hg38/factor* /data/mysql/hg38/.</code>
</pre>
<p>
You can also download gbdb files in this manner.
<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::gbdb/hg19/multiz100way/phyloP100way.wib /data/gbdb/hg19/multiz100way/.</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>sudo rsync hgdownload-euro.soe.ucsc.edu::gbdb/hg19/multiz100way/phyloP100way.wib /data/gbdb/hg19/multiz100way/.</code>
</pre>

<p>The above command would copy the phyloP100way track to display in the GBiB from a local file.</p>

<h3>Offline mode</h3>
<p>
GBiB has an offline mode that is particularly useful when you want to ensure that GBiB no longer 
connects to the Internet once the initial download and setup are complete (for instance, to comply 
with corporate IT policy). Before going offline, first mirror all the tracks that you will want to 
access. Then, in the GBiB terminal window type the command: <code>gbibOffline</code>. This command 
will remove GBiB's network access to the UCSC MariaDB server and download servers.</p>
<p>
Once GBiB is in offline mode, the Genome Browser will display an error message if you attempt to
access a data file not located on your local disk; therefore, we do not recommend this option for 
general use. To reactivate Internet access, click on the GBiB terminal window and type the command: 
<code>gbibOnline</code>.</p>

<a name="UpdatingGbib"></a>
<h2>Updating Genome Browser in a Box</h2>
<p>
The software that supports the UCSC Genome Browser is updated every three weeks. These updates
include new features and bug fixes for existing features. The track data, on the other hand,
are not updated on a regular basis. New tracks and updates to existing tracks are released as
they pass UCSC's quality assurance process. The only exceptions to this are GenBank-based tracks, 
including RefSeq Genes, GenBank mRNAs, and others, which are updated weekly through an
automatic process.</p>

<h3>Automatic updates</h3>
<p>
By default, GBiB is configured to automatically update its files, including software and tracks
that you have mirrored. The updates will not affect your custom tracks, user accounts or sessions.
We recommend that you leave the auto-update process turned on if Internet connection speed is not 
an issue, to ensure that you receive all the latest software features and bug fixes, as well as 
updates to your mirrored tracks.</p>
<p>
If you are using a DSL line, we recommend turning off automatic updates. Over a slow internet 
connection, the GBiB update may take several hours to complete, during which time the software will 
be unusable. To turn off the auto-update process, start GBiB, then type the command
<code>gbibAutoUpdateOff</code> in the GBiB terminal window.</p> 
<p>
The auto-update process can be reactivated by typing the command <code>gbibAutoUpdateOn</code>.</p>

<a name="ManualUpdates"></a>
<h3>Manual updates</h3>
<p>
As an alternative to the auto-update process, you can manually update GBiB. To do so, start GBiB and
type the command <code>updateBrowser</code> in the GBiB terminal window. This will run the script 
that updates the GBiB software and any annotation tracks that you have mirrored. A manual update is 
sometimes an effective solution when GBiB is functioning incorrectly or stops working (see the 
<a href="#Trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section).</p>

<a name="YourTracks"></a>
<h2>Viewing your own data</h2>
<p>
In addition to providing access to the standard set of Genome Browser annotation tracks generated by
UCSC, GBiB allows you to upload your own data in the form of custom annotation tracks. These tracks 
can be viewed in the Genome Browser alongside the native UCSC tracks.</p>
<p>
Uploading your custom annotation tracks to GBiB is similar in many ways to the process used for
uploading custom tracks on the public UCSC Genome Browser website. Custom tracks containing smaller 
data sets can be uploaded to GBiB through the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom">Add Custom Tracks</a>
page.  For more information on generating and uploading custom tracks, see the 
<a href="customTrack.html">Custom Track help page</a>. One big difference, however, is that GBiB has
a built-in web server that can communicate directly with your computer. This eliminates the 
requirement that local big data files be hosted on a separate publicly accessible web server. As a 
result, your data remains private to your own computer, and will not be available to others unless 
you grant them access (see <a href="#LocalTracks">Loading local big data tracks and track 
hubs</a>).</p>

<a name="LocalTracks"></a>
<h3>Loading local big data tracks and track hubs</h3>
<p>
For improved display performance in the Genome Browser, big data sets are typically stored in a 
compressed, indexed binary file format such as <a href="bigBed.html">bigBed</a>, 
<a href="bigWig.html">bigWig</a>, <a href="bam.html">BAM</a>, or <a href="vcf.html">VCF</a> that 
contains the data at several resolutions. Unlike custom tracks, in which the entire data set is 
loaded at once, big data files transmit only the data for the region currently displayed. In order 
to load and display data in one of these formats, the public Genome Browser website requires big 
data files to be placed on a publicly accessible web server. However, because GBiB acts as its own 
web server, your computer can share local big data files directly with GBiB for easy uploading as a
custom track.</p>
<p>
In addition to custom tracks, you can use <a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html">track hubs</a> and
<a href="hgTrackHubHelp.html#Assembly">assembly hubs</a> to easily view your data in GBiB. Track 
hubs are web-accessible directories of genomic data that offer a broader set of configuration and 
integration options than custom annotation tracks. Assembly hubs are an extension of track hubs and 
allow you to specify a file containing your novel genomic sequence, in addition to custom annotation
data. One strong advantage of track and assembly hubs are that they persist until you delete them, 
in contrast to custom tracks outside of saved sessions that will automatically expire and be removed
from the server after a few days. As with big data tracks, the GBiB built-in web server circumvents 
the requirement that track and assembly hubs be uploaded to a public accessible server prior to 
viewing. For more information see <a href="hubQuickStartAssembly.html#blatGbib" 
target="_blank">Starting a Blat enabled Assembly Hub on GBiB</a>.</p>
<p>
Loading local files, such as hubs or big data files, requires that GBiB has access the to local 
folder containing them. To allow GBiB to access one or more of your local folders, follow these 
steps:</p>

<div class="row">
  <!-- Left column -->
  <div class="col-md-4">
    <p>
    <strong>Step 1.</strong> Shut down the GBiB virtual machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping 
    GBiB</a>)</p>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 2.</strong> Allow VirtualBox access to one or more directories on your hard 
    disk</p> 
    <ol>
      <li>
      Click on the &quot;browserbox&quot; entry in the VirtualBox Manager window, then click 
      <em>Settings</em>.</li>
      <li>
      Click on <em>Shared Folders</em>.</li>
      <li>
      Click on the small &quot;+&quot; icon.</li>
      <li>
      Select a directory on your disk under <em>Folder Path / Other</em>.</li>
      <li>
      Select the checkbox to give &quot;Read-only&quot; access and make sure the checkbox for 
      &quot;Auto-mount&quot; is selected.</li>
      <li>
      Confirm by clicking &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
      <li>
      Repeat these steps with other folders, as needed.</li>
      <li>
      When you are finished, restart GBiB by clicking the &quot;Start&quot; button again.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <!-- Right column -->
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <img src="../../images/gbib-shared.png" alt="GBiB shared" width="683" height="465">
  </div>
</div>

<p>
To check if your folders are shared, type this address into your web browser:
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders</a>. It should
show all shared folders. To obtain the bigDataUrl of any of the files in your shared folders, 
right-click on any file and select &quot;Copy link address&quot;. You can now paste this URL into 
the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgCustom" target="_blank">Add Custom Tracks</a> page. Or, if you are
uploading a track or assembly hub, right-click on your &quot;hub.txt&quot; file and select
&quot;Copy link address&quot;. You can now paste this URL into the box on the &quot;Connected Hubs&quot;
tab of the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgHubConnect" target="_blank">Track Data Hubs</a> page.</p>

<a name="loadBam"></a>
<h3><em>Example: Loading a local BAM custom track</em></h3>
<p>
Here is an example of a custom track in a shared test/ folder that loads a locally hosted
BAM file when pasted on the custom tracks page (select <em>My Data >> Custom Tracks</em>
in the Genome Browser menu):
<pre><code>track type=bam name=BamExample bigDataUrl=http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/test/bamExample.bam </code></pre>
<p>
To customize this URL for your own use, replace the URL with a pasted URL to files from your own
machine discoverable under the <em>My Data >> GBiB Shared Data Folder</em> in the Genome Browser menu.
Since the GBiB is configured so that the VirtualBox shared folder path can be placed directly into the
custom track page (via a line <code>udc.localDir=/folders</code> in the hg.conf file) and there
is software that knows files ending in <code>.bam</code> should be loaded as <code>type=bam</code>,
the link can be replaced with just a path to the file. For example, pasting the following on the
custom tracks page would also work:</p>
<pre><code>/folders/test/bamExample.bam </code></pre>

<a name="Connectwithssh"></a>
<h3>Connecting to GBiB with ssh</h3>
<p>
The GBiB terminal is a normal Linux command line interface. For easier use of the command line, you 
can connect to the GBiB machine from your computer with ssh. This may offer better speed and more 
functionality, such as support for copy/paste.</p>
<p>
To connect to GBiB with ssh, open a terminal on your computer and type: <code>ssh browser@localhost 
-p 1235</code>. You will be prompted for a password when attempting to access GBiB from your 
computer's command line. The password is &quot;browser&quot;. Alternatively you can use
<code>sudo</code> for root access, which does not require a password. Because stock Windows 
computers do not have ssh installed, Windows users will have to use the GBiB terminal or install a 
third-party ssh client for Windows, such as the free software <a href="http://putty.org" 
target="_blank">Putty</a>.</p>

<h3>Data and track conversion tools</h3>
<p>
By default, GBiB includes a few of the commonly used UCSC file manipulation tools, such as 
bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig, samtools and tabix. These tools can be used to convert and manipulate your
basic files into formats that can be uploaded to GBiB as custom tracks. If you need additional 
Genome Browser tools, type the following command into the GBiB terminal window:
<code>gbibAddTools</code>. This command downloads and installs the full suite of command line tools 
provided by UCSC. Many of these extra tools can be used to extract data and other useful information
from your files, or to convert them between various file types. A complete listing and description 
for all of these tools can be found on UCSC's
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/FOOTER" target="_blank">download 
server</a>.</p>
<p>
You can use these tools to convert and extract data from your shared files with the standard
&quot;Read-only&quot; settings. However, if you would like to to modify files you've shared with 
your GBiB, you will have to ensure that the &quot;Read-only&quot; access for VirtualBox is turned 
off. To do so, follow the directions in Step 2 of the <a href="#LocalTracks">Loading local big data 
tracks</a> section, but deselect the checkbox next to &quot;Read-only&quot;.</p>
<p>
Please note that the gbibAddTools command requires sudo permissions.</p>

<h3><em>Example: Indexing a local BAM file</em></h3>
<p>
A BAM file must be indexed before it can be loaded into the browser. For example, to index a BAM 
file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk, type:</p> 
<pre><code>cd /folders/Documents
samtools index my.sorted.bam </code></pre>

<h3><em>Example: Using a format conversion tool</em></h3>
<p>
BED files must be converted to bigBed format to be loaded into the browser. For example, to convert 
a .bed file in a shared folder &quot;Documents&quot; on your hard disk to a .bigBed format file, 
type:</p> 
<pre><code>cd /folders/Documents
fetchChromSizes hg19 &gt; hg19.sizes
bedToBigBed bedExample.txt hg19.sizes myBigBed.bb </code></pre>

<h3><em>Example: Loading a GEO File</em></h3>
<p>
Some files at external locations, like GEO, are already in binary indexed formats that can be loaded
in the browser over the Internet. However, if the server providing these files does not accept 
byte-range requests, they cannot be transmitted over the Internet to view in the browser. For GEO 
files, try the ftp location first. If you find the files of interest are giving byte-range request 
errors, then one option is to download the files and locally load them from your own laptop. With 
GBiB you can download these files to a local shared folder and then browse them. In the following
example the URL of the bigWig (.bw) file was obtained for the wget by right clicking the http link 
for this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM1186795">GSM1186795</a> 
example, that only displays data on chrM and chrX.</p> 
<pre><code>ssh browser@localhost -p 1235  (to enter GBiB from your computer terminal, password: browser)
cd /folders
sudo wget
"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSM1186795&format=file&file=GSM1186795%5FDZ012%5FTRA1%5FN2L3%5Ftr27%5Fce10%5FBTm1x200n%2Ebw" -O GSM1186795.bw </code></pre>
<p>
The file can then be found in the GBiB's 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/"><code>http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/</code></a> location, 
or loaded with a direct link to the files location:</p> 

<pre><code><a href="http://127.0.0.1:1234/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hgt.customText=http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/GSM1186795.bw&position=chrM" 
target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:1234/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&hgt.customText=<strong>http://127.0.0.1:1234/folders/GSM1186795.bw</strong>&position=chrM</a></code></pre>
<p>
(NOTE: In this above example, the <strong>ftp location</strong> now has byte-range requests 
supported so the <strong>GEO ftp link</strong> can be loaded on the browser).</p>

<a name="CustomizingGbib"></a>
<h2>Customizing your GBiB</h2>

<h3>Allowing local-only assemblies</h3>
<p>By modifying the MySQL table hgcentral.dbDb one can add a genome directly to
the UCSC Genome Browser, as documented in <a
    href="mirrorManual.html#adding-a-new-custom-non-ucsc-genome-to-the-browser">
our manual mirror instructions</a>. We discourage this, as assembly hubs,
especially in combination with a "default cart" (see below) are much easier to
setup. However, if you have an existing local genome browser installation with
genomes that only exist only there, in order to combine its "remote access" mode with
a local-only genome, the local genome has to be declared in hg.conf, or for GBIB, 
rather /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/hg.conf.local. The statement is
<pre>slow-db.excludeDbs=assemblyName1,assemblyName2</pre>
For example, if you have two local-only assemblies defined in dbDb with the
names homSap1 and homSap2, the
statement <pre>slow-db.excludeDbs=homSap1,homSap2</pre> will instruct the browser to 
never try to connect
to the UCSC Public MySQL server for these two assemblies, avoiding error messages
and significantly speeding up the display.
</p>

<!--
<a name="Fonts"></a>
<h3>Enabling additional font styles</h3>
<p>
To enable the use of additional fonts in the tracks display, the following lines
need to be need to be added to the <code>hg.conf</code> file:</p>
<pre>
freeType=on
freeTypeDir=/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts
</pre>
<p>
The file can be found in the following location:</p>
<pre>
/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/hg.conf
</pre>
<p>
The fonts can then be change by pressing the <strong>configuration</strong> located below the 
image on the tracks display.</p>.
-->

<a name="Defaults"></a>
<h3>Changing the default Genome Browser options on a GBiB</h3>
<p>
GBiB supports changes to some default settings such as assembly, attached hubs, fonts, text size, 
etc. Changing these defaults means that any time a new user goes to the mirror, or whenver 
all user settings are reset, the custom options will be enabled. This can be useful in cases
when it is desirable to have hubs attached by default, to change the default assembly or
visibility display, etc.</p>
<p>
The first step is to create a <a href="#UsrAcct">Session</a> containing all desired display
options, hubs, etc. Then a file will be created from within the GBiB that contains the 
command to create a new MySQL table: <strong>defaultCart</strong>. See the 
<a href="#Connectwithssh">Connect with ssh</a> section of this page for help logging into
your GBiB. Contents of new file <strong>defaultCart.sql</strong>:</p>
<pre>
#The default cart
CREATE TABLE defaultCart (
    contents longblob not null	# cart contents
);
</pre>
<p>
The table can then be loaded:</p>
<pre>
mysql hgcentral < defaultCart.sql
</pre>
<p>
Finally, the contents of the desired session can be entered into the new table.</p>
<pre>
mysql hgcentral -Ne "insert into defaultCart select contents from namedSessionDb where sessionName='nameOfSession' and userName='nameOfUser'"
</pre>
</p>
Where <strong>nameOfSession</strong> is the name of the created session and 
<strong>nameOfUser</strong> is the name of the user the session was created under. Keep
in mind that only the top entry in that table will be used to pull default variables, so
to change the new defaults (or to remove the new dedaults) you will first want
to delete the table contents:</p>
<pre>
mysql hgcentral -Ne "delete from defaultCart"
</pre>

<a name="SharingGBIB"></a>
<h2>Sharing Genome Browser in a Box with others</h2>
<p>
By default, GBiB can be accessed only from the machine on which it is installed. This is done to 
prevent others from accessing your data. You can, however, make your GBiB instance available for use
by others. To open up external access to GBiB:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Shut down the GBiB machine (<a href="#GbibStop">Stopping GBiB</a>).</li>
  <li>
  Select the browserbox machine in the VirtualBox left-hand menubar.</li>
  <li>
  Select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Settings</em> in the VirtualBox menu to display the Settings 
  window.</li>
  <li>
  Go to <em>Network &gt;&gt; Adapter 1 &gt;&gt; Advanced &gt;&gt; Port Forwarding</em>.</li>
  <li>
  Remove the address &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; from &quot;Rule 1&quot; by deleting it with the 
  backspace key.</li>
  <li>
  Click &quot;OK&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> In addition to enabling port forwarding for VirtualBox, you may need to 
enable the port forwarding functionality on your PC's firewall to allow others to access your GBiB. 
You will have to search online for instructions on how to enable this functionality for your PC's 
firewall.</p>
<p>
Once you have opened external access to GBiB, your colleagues can access and use your GBiB instance 
by typing your IP address into their own Internet browser, followed by the :1234 port. <strong>Keep 
in mind that once you have opened up GBiB for remote access, anyone who knows your IP address 
will be able to access your instance of GBiB and the files that you have shared with
it.</strong></p>
<p>
To control access by others to configure track mirroring in your shared GBiB, you can use
the commands <code>gbibMirrorOff</code> and <code>gbibMirrorOn</code> to disable or enable the
&quot;Mirror Tracks&quot; function in the menu.</p>

<a name="UsrAcct"></a>
<h2>User accounts and sessions</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgSession">Session</a> tool allows you to take a snapshot of your browser
configured with specific track combinations, including 
<a href="hgTracksHelp.html#CustomTracks">custom tracks</a>. A browser session can be saved for 
future use or shared with others who use your GBiB instance.</p>
<p> 
To use the Session tool, you must first create a user account. User accounts and sessions on GBiB 
are separate from those maintained on the UCSC Genome Browser public website. Because of this, user 
names and sessions that you create on GBiB cannot be used with the main UCSC Genome Browser 
website, and vice versa. More information on creating a user account and creating, saving, and 
sharing sessions can be found in the <a href="hgSessionHelp.html">Sessions User's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>
Username recovery on accounts is not supported at this time; however, you can recover a lost
password. The system for recovering lost passwords on GBiB is much different from that on the
Genome Browser and requires access to the command line. To recover a lost password:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Navigate to the <a href="../../cgi-bin/hgLogin?hgLogin.do.displayLoginPage=1" 
  target="blank">account login page</a>.</li>
  <li>
  Click on the &quot;Can't access your account?&quot; link on the login page.</li>
  <li>
  Select the &quot;I forgot my password. Send me a new one.&quot; option and enter your 
  username.</li>
  <li>
  An email message will be sent to the Alpine email client included with VirtualBox.</li>
  <li>
  To access the email client, click on the GBiB terminal window.</li>
  <li>
  In this window, type <code>mail</code> and press &quot;enter&quot;, which will bring up the Alpine
  email client.</li>
  <li>
  Select <code>MESSAGE INDEX</code> from the menu and press enter.</li>
  <li>
  Select the message with &quot;New temporary password...&quot; in the subject line.</li>
  <li>
  Log in using your username and this temporary password.</li>
  <li>
  After logging in, you will be prompted to create a new password.</li>
  <li>
  Once you are finished, exit the Alpine email client by pressing &quot;Q&quot; and then 
  &quot;Y&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Please be aware that anyone with access to your username and the command line interface of 
your GBiB can change your password.</strong></p>

<a name="Trouble"></a>
<h2>Troubleshooting common problems</h2>
<p>
This section addresses some common errors and problems that you may encounter while setting up and 
installing GBiB. It is not intended as a comprehensive list. If you experience a problem not listed 
below, please email the UCSC Genome Browser public support mailing list at 
<a href="mailto:&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.e&#100;u">
&#103;&#101;n&#111;m&#101;&#64;&#115;&#111;e.&#117;&#99;&#115;&#99;.e&#100;u</a>. Note that messages

<p>
<strong>VirtualBox Error:</strong> &quot;<em>VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but
is not operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to 
boot.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 1: </em>Some older entry-level laptops from around 2009-2011 (e.g. Toshiba Satellite 
U500) were sold with CPUs that do not support virtualization. These laptops cannot run GBiB. The 
same applies to low-cost laptops (&quot;netbooks&quot;) with Intel Atom processors.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 2: </em>On some hardware, virtualization is supported but deactivated in the BIOS. 
Here is one example of how virtualization support is activated on some hardware. Note that your BIOS
virtualization options may differ from those described here.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Reboot the computer and press F12 during boot to show the BIOS menu.</li>
  <li>
  Go to <em>BIOS Setup &gt;&gt; Virtualization Support &gt;&gt; Virtualization</em> and check 
  &quot;Enable Intel Virtualization Technology&quot;. On some Dell systems, you may need to enable 
  additional virtualization options under the BIOS Setup. Go to 
  <em>Virtualization Support &gt;&gt; Virtualization for Direct I/O</em> and check 
  &quot;Enable Virtualization for Direct I/O&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  Exit and save, then restart the computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>VirtualBox Error:</strong> &quot;<em>Failed to open virtual machine located in... Trying to open a VM 
	config ...  which has the same UUID as an existing virtual machine.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution: </em> This error occurs if GBiB has been previously downloaded and installed. To 
resolve this problem:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Start VirtualBox.</li>
  <li>
  Select the currently installed version of browserbox from the left-hand column.</li>
  <li>
  Select <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Remove</em> (Ctrl+R or &#8984;+R) in the VirtualBox menu. When asked, 
  choose &quot;Remove only&quot; to retain the old browserbox version on your disk.</li>
  <li>
  Double-click the newly downloaded <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file or add it with the 
  <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em> menu option.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>VirtualBox Error:</strong> &quot;<em>Failed to open virtual machine located in... Cannot 
register the hard disk ... because a hard disk ... already exists.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution:</em> This error occurs if GBiB has been previously downloaded and installed. To 
resolve this problem:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  Start VirtualBox.</li>
  <li>
  Select <em>File &gt;&gt; Virtual Media Manager</em> (Ctrl+D or &#8984;+D) in the VirtualBox 
  menubar.</li>
  <li>
  Select <em>gbib-data.vdi</em> and click &quot;Remove&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  Double-click the newly downloaded <em>browserbox.vbox</em> file or add it with 
  <em>Machine &gt;&gt; Add</em> menu option.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Genome Browser Error:</strong> &quot;<em>Couldn't connect to database hg19 on 
genome-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu as genomep.</em>&quot;
<p>
<em>Solution 1:</em> This indicates that the virtual machine could not connect to the UCSC MariaDB 
server. This error can be caused by a change of the IP address (e.g. on a wifi connection) that has 
not yet been picked up by the virtual machine. In this situation, you can restart the box or run 
the command <code>sudo ifup --force eth0</code> to reset the network connection.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 2:</em> Alternatively, this error may be generated when the firewall does not allow 
outgoing TCP data on port 3306/MySQL. In this case, contact your institution's IT support staff to 
inquire about ways to open this port.</p>
<p>
<strong>Genome Browser Error:</strong> &quot;<em>Couldn't connect to database hgcentral on localhost
as root. Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket 
'/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (13)</em>&quot;</p>
<p>
<em>Solution:</em> This error can be caused when the virtual machine is downloading data such as
when using the <a href="#GbibMirroring">mirror tool</a> to install local copies of tracks to 
increase speed and performance. Once the download finishes, the message will no longer appear. If 
one cancels a download in progress, the error can persist, in which case restart your virtual 
machine and the message should be removed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong> Error when using BLAT.</p>
<p>
When you use BLAT on your GBiB machine, it attempts to open outgoing TCP connections to the BLAT 
servers running at UCSC. Each assembly has two ports that need to be open from your GBiB machine
to the UCSC BLAT servers. You will likely need to contact the system administrators at your 
institution and ask them to open outgoing TCP connections to a list of UCSC hostnames and ports. 
The commands below will allow you to find out the names of these hosts and ports.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution:</em> To find the hostname-port combination to open from your GBiB machine, use this 
SQL query:</p> 
<pre><code>mysql hgcentral -e 'select * from blatServers where db="YOURDB"'</code></pre>
<p>
For example, if you want to enable BLAT for hg19 and hg38, you can issue this command:
<pre><code>mysql hgcentral -e 'select * from blatServers where db="hg38" or db="hg19"'</code></pre>
<pre><code>+------+---------------------+-------+---------+--------+
| db   | host                | port  | isTrans | canPcr |
+------+---------------------+-------+---------+--------+
| hg19 | blat4a.soe.ucsc.edu | 17779 |       0 |      1 |
| hg19 | blat4a.soe.ucsc.edu | 17778 |       1 |      0 |
| hg38 | blat4c.soe.ucsc.edu | 17781 |       0 |      1 |
| hg38 | blat4c.soe.ucsc.edu | 17780 |       1 |      0 |
+------+---------------------+-------+---------+--------+</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong> GBiB is functioning incorrectly or stops working.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 1:</em> If you have previously turned off automatic updates, your software or data 
may need updating. Try <a href="#ManualUpdates">manually updating</a> GBiB. This update process may 
take several hours over a slow Internet connection.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution 2:</em> Re-download the <em>gbib.zip</em> file and extract <strong>only</strong> the 
file <em>gbib-root.vdi</em>. Place this file in the same directory with the files extracted from
your original GBiB installation. Do not extract and overwrite <em>gbib-data.vdi</em> -- it contains 
your personal track and session settings and mirrored tracks.</p>
<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong> I need proxy support for my files to load.</p>
<p>
<em>Solution:</em> Proxy servers may be required by some installations to get through a firewall. 
You can add the settings <code>httpProxy</code>, <code>httpsProxy</code> and <code>ftpProxy</code> to hg.conf.local at
/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/hg.conf.local:</p>
<pre><code>httpProxy=http://someProxyServer:3128</code></pre>
<pre><code>httpsProxy=http://someProxyServer:3128</code></pre>
<pre><code>ftpProxy=ftp://127.0.0.1:2121</code></pre>
<p>
If the proxy server requires BASIC authentication, then the line in hg.conf.local should look like
this:</p>
<pre><code>httpProxy=http://user:password@someProxyServer:3128</code></pre>
<pre><code>httpsProxy=http://user:password@someProxyServer:3128</code></pre>
<p>
If there are domains or domain-suffices that should not be proxied, use <code>noProxy</code>.
<pre><code>noProxy=ucsc.edu,mit.edu,localhost,127.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>
The file /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/hg.conf should already include a line like <code>include
hg.conf.local</code> to incorporate the changes in hg.conf.local.</p>

<p>
<strong>Problem:</strong> "No space left on device" error when running gbibAddTools.</p>
<p>
In older GBiB's, there is an error in the <code>gbibAddTools</code> command. To fix this command, 
edit the <code>/home/browser/.bashrc</code> file and change the following line:
<pre><code>alias gbibAddTools='mkdir ~/bin -p; rsync -avP hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::genome/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/ ~/bin/'</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
to either of the follwing lines:
<pre><code>alias gbibAddTools='sudo mkdir -p /data/tools; sudo rsync -avP hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu::genome/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/ /data/tools/ && ln -s /data/tools ~/bin'</code></pre>
<pre><code>alias gbibAddTools='sudo mkdir -p /data/tools; sudo rsync -avP hgdownload-euro.soe.ucsc.edu::genome/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/ /data/tools/ && ln -s /data/tools ~/bin'</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
The updated commands will install the tools to a location with more disk space available using
either the North American or European hgdownload servers.
</p>
