of the $organism genome.

<P>
Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
All components within this track are of fragment type &quot;D&quot;: 
Whole Genome Shotgun draft contig.  The mitochondrial genome sequence
is included under the name of &quot;chrM&quot; from the genbank accession:
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/23395805"
TARGET=_blank>NC_004298.1</A> and is type &quot;F&quot;: finished sequence.

This draft assembly is composed of 27,211 contigs for a total size of
95,828,100 nucleotides.  The largest contig, Bmal_supercontig14972, is
6,534,162 nucleotides.  One half of the sequence, 47,914,050 bases,
is contained in 253 contigs, all of at least 37,841 bases (N50).
There are 59,379 sequences of gap in these contigs, for a total
of 6,592,564 nucleotides indicated in the sequence by &quot;N&quot;.
