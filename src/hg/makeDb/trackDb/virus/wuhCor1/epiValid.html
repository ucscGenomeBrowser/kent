<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows epitopes that were validated in published studies, mostly from the SARS 2003 outbreak.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The epitope sequences were collected by Nerli et al, partially from the IEDB database, partially
from the original literature. The details page shows how similar the SARS-Cov-2 epitope is to the
SARS epitope.

<h2>Credits</h2>
The UCSC SARS-CoV-2 genome browser and associated data annotation tracks were
funded by generous private donors to the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.
