<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows RefSeq genes curated by the Rat Genome Database (RGD).
Coding exons are represented by 
blocks connected by horizontal lines representing introns. The 5' and 3' 
untranslated regions (UTRs) are displayed as thinner blocks on the leading 
and trailing ends of the aligning regions. In full display mode, arrowheads 
on the connecting intron lines indicate the direction of transcription.</P>
