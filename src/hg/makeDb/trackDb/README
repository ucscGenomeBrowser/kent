This directory contains the track database for
the UCSC human genome browser.  The program
hgTrackDb converts the information here into
a 'trackDb' table in the hgN MySQL database.

SEE ALSO: source tree file: src/product/README.trackDb
	for a general discussion of developing tracks.

	http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/hgFindSpecHowTo.html
	for instructions on hgFindSpec. 

The bulk of the information about a track is
contained in the trackDb.ra file.  Tracks are
separated from each other in this file by 
a blank line.  Each line begins with an
attribute name and is followed by attribute
value separated by white space.

The html text about a track is in separate
files named xxx.html where xxx is a
track name.   

There may be subdirectories for each organism such
as 'mouse', and underneath these directories for
each database, such as 'hg7'.  There are a trackDb.ra 
file and xxx.html files in these subdirectories.
Tracks descriptions in the subdirectory will
over-ride track descriptions in the parent directory.
This allows you to customize a track for
each version of the database.

After editing a track definition here
hgTrackDb to bring it into the MySQL database.  To update
your personal copy (on hgwdev-userName) do
    make update
to do it on genome-test do
    make alpha
You can also restrict a track to alpha or beta using
by using the release field.

THE TYPE FIELD

One of the most important and complicated fields in the
trackDb.ra file is the type field.  Here's an explanation
of that field.  Explanations of several other less-than-obvious
fields follow.

Currently there are fourteen different track types:
axt, bed, chain, clonePos, ctgPos, expRatio, genePred,
maf, netAlign, psl, rmsk, sample, wigMaf and wig

	(notation: <angle brackets> indicate required field,
		[square brackets] indicate optional field)

The format of the type fields:

1. type axt <otherDb>
   <otherDb> - other database this organism is aligned to
2. type bed <fieldCount> <extraInfo>
   <fieldCount> - the number of standard fields
   <extraInfo> - either '.' meaning no non-standard fields
       or '+' if there are additional non-standard fields.
3. type chain <otherDb>
   Alignment data
   <otherDb> - other database this organism is aligned to
4. type clonePos
   unique for Clone Coverage track on human assemblies
5. type ctgPos
   unique for Physical Map Contigs track on human assemblies
6. type expRatio
    DNA chip expression data
    Nothing follows expRatio, but the following fields
    must be defined elsewhere in the trackDb.ra record:
       expTable - table in hgFixed with names of experiments etc.
       expScale - maximum expression value
       expStep - amount to step in visible expression scale.  Some
           round number close to expScale/8 is best
       expColorDense On - show avg. color in dense mode
       chip - Name of microarray chip.
7. type genePred [pep_table] [mrna_table]
   Gene prediction data, use '.' when a positional parameter must be skipped
   [pep_table] - optional associated protein sequence table
   [mrna_table] - optional associated representative mRNA table
   [autoTranslate] - if set to 0 then translated protein won't be generated
      in the details page.
   Optional fields to be defined elsewhere in the trackDb.ra record:
	itemAttrTbl - table used to color individual items in a track, 
                      selected by name and locations.
                     
8. type maf 
    A type of multiple alignment track, becoming obsolete, 
        to be replaced by wigMaf 
9. type netAlign <otherDb> <otherDbChainTable>
   <otherDb>
   <otherDbChainTable>
   Also requires an otherDb field to be defined in the trackDb.ra record
10. type psl <subtype> [otherDb]
   <subtype> - one of: est, mrna, protein, xeno or .
      Where . means regular human mRNA
   [otherDb] - optional xeno subtype, database associated
      with other organism.  If present the display can be colored by
      chromosome and the chromosome and position in kilobases is shown
      as the item label.
   Optional variable here, for psl tracks that also have sequence loaded.
   The presence of this option in the trackDb entry enables its function.
   pslSequence no		# allows user to select the other two
   pslSequence all		# show nucleotide labels on all bases
   pslSequence different	# show nucleotide labes only on different bases
11. type rmsk
   Unique type for Repeat Masker tracks
12. type sample [min] [max]
   A continuous value graphing type of track.
   Becoming obsolete, replaced by the 'type wig' tracks.
   [min] - optional minimum limit of data, default 0.  Used just for label.
   [max] - optional maximum limit of data, default 1000. Used just for label.
13. type wigMaf <minVal> <maxVal>
   A composite type of track to graph multiple and pairwise alignments.
   track name is table name of the multiple alignment maf table,
        with associated maf file in /gbdb (loaded with hgLoadMaf)
   type line includes data value range for conservation wiggle,
         as for wig track 
   standard wig track settings may be included (e.g. 
        maxHeightPixels, yLineOnOff, autoScaleDefault).  These
        apply to both conservation and pairwise wiggles
   Settings in the trackDb.ra record:
      wiggle - contains table names of conservation wiggles
                          (loaded with hgLoadWiggle)
        in the format:
    "wiggle <table1> <leftLabel1> <uiLabel1>... <tableN> <leftLabelN> <uiLabelN>"
           where the first table is the default. The left label is used
           to prefix the label 'Cons' in the left label area of the
           conservation wiggle display.  The UI label is displayed on 
           the trackUI page.  If only one table is listed, and no label 
           is present, the default label "Conservation" will be displayed. 
           The labels cannot contain spaces -- underscores in the labels
           are translated to spaces in the display.
      speciesOrder - specifies the order of each pairwise items in the display
        Each species is specified as in the MAF file
        Organism names with embedded dots and/or spaces,
        these are stripped and replaced with underscore.
        E.g. (C. elegans -> c_elegans).
      speciesGroup - list of "clades" to group the species
        This option is an alternative to speciesOrder, used when
        there are many species.  Each speciesGroup in the list must have it's
        own setting (sGroup_<group>), followed by a list of species,
        specified as for speciesOrder.
      speciesTree - the phylogenetic tree for the species represented
        in the maf. This will be used for the "show shortest path" display
	mode if "speciesTarget" is defined. 
      speciesTarget - the default species target for the "show shortest path"
        mode of maf display. If this setting is present, then the default 
	maf display is "show shortest path".
      treeImage - path from web server htdocs dir (normally /images)
            to a file containing a picture of the phylogenetic tree for
            this track
      pairwise - contains suffix of the pairwise maf tables.
            The prefix is generated from the species name, as specified above.
            An underscore is used to separate (e.g. chimp_hmrg if
            setting is "hmrg").  If there is a wig table named
            <species>_<suffix>_wig, this is used for pairwise display.
            In this case, the wiggle height for the pairwise can
            be specified as the last word on this line.
            (e.g. pairwise CFTR 20, will have 20 pixel height of
            pairwise wiggle from tables named <species>_CFTR_wig).
      pairwiseHeight N - sets pixel height of pairwise in full mode
      summary - contains table name of maf summary table (used as 
            replacement for "pairwise" tables, above.  A summary
            table is created from a multiple alignment maf file
            using the utility hgLoadMafSummary.
      speciesDefaultOff - contains a list of species that are
            not displayed in the track display unless explicitly
            configured in from the track config page.
      itemFirstCharCase - this controls if species names in the multiple alignment 
            should be capitalized in the pairwise display.

14. type wig [lower] [upper]
   Continuous value graphing track.
   [lower] - overall lower limit of the data, default 0.0
   [upper] - overall upper limit of the data, default 127.0
   trackDb record options:
      autoScale         on|off               # default is off
      gridDefault       on|off               # default is off (draw y=0.0 line)
      maxHeightPixels   max:default:min      # default is 128:128:11
      graphType         bar|points           # default is bar
      viewLimits        lower:upper    # default is from the type line limits
      yLineMark         real-value     # default is 0.0
      yLineOnOff        on|off         # default is off (draw y=yLineMark line)
      windowingFunction maximum|mean|minimum # default is maximum
      smoothingWindow   off|[2-16]           # default is off
      wigColorBy        <bed table>          # use colors in bed for wiggle
                                             #   in overlapping regions
      spanList          s1,s2,s3...          # list of spans in the loaded table
		#	you can find the spans by doing:
		#	"select span from <table> group by span"
		#	typically spanList is only one:
		#	spanList 1
		#	rarely it may be more:
		#	spanList 1,1000
		#	special efforts must be made to load extra spans
		#	into the table for special purposes.
15. type bedGraph [column]
   Same type of graphing function as #14 above 'type wig'
   In this case, the data table is a bed type of table loaded
   with hgLoadBed.  The [column] specified is a numeric column of data
   in the table to be used for the graphing value.  The default column
   to graph would be column five, the 'score'.  All graphing options as
   described above in 'type wig' apply to this type of track.
   Two extra options are used here to specify maximum graphing bounds:
      minLimit <value>   # default is 0
      maxLimit <value>   # default is 1000

16. type chromGraph
   This draws lines connecting sparse, variably spaced data points.
   Use wiggle for regularly spaced or dense data.  When using chromGraph
   the following other settings may be used:
       maxGapToFill <value> # default is 25000.  No line will be drawn between
                            # data points further apart than this
       maxHeightPixels <max:val:min>  # default 100:32:8
                            # Specifies allowed and actual height in full mode.
       minMax <min,max> # default is calculated from data in track
                            # Specifies displayed data range
       linesAt <val1,val2,...> # Default is none
                            # If present labeled horizontal lines will be drawn
			    # at the given values in full mode.
    
If something lacks a type field it needs to have custom
display routines.   You can remove a track from the
browser by removing it from the .ra file and doing
a make update.

OTHER FIELDS

There are a number of generic attributes that can be used with any track type:

Attribute    -    Possible values             - controls

spectrum     -    on                          - same effect as useScore
thickDrawItem  -  on                          - keep width of bed item at least
                                              - 3 pixels wide even at great
                                              - zoom levels
color        -    r,g,b integer triplet       - specifies primary color
                                              - for items.
                                              - red,green,blue values 0 to 255

chromosomes  -    comma separated list        - only these chroms have data
                                              - for this track, this track is
                                              - not shown on other chroms
scoreFilterMax -  integer                     - for score column trackUi filter

The shortLabel and longLabel fields may have the following
variables, which will be substituted:
     $ORGANISM - all upper case organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $Organism - initial capped organism, like 'Mouse'
     $organism - all lower case organism, like 'mouse'
     $db - database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $date - freeze date of underlying assembly
     $blurb - If there is a blurb field in the .ra file this echos it.
In addition if there is a $otherDb field set in the .ra file these
variables are available
     $o_ORGANISM - all upper case other organism, like 'MOUSE'
     $o_Organism - initial capped other organism, like 'Mouse'
     $o_organism - all lower case other organism, like 'mouse'
     $o_db - other database (like mm3, hg15, etc.)
     $o_date - freeze date of underlying other assembly

If there is a colorChromDefault field (values "on" or "off"), it
is used to set the default value for chromosome coloring
in affected tracks (type psl xeno <db>).  Without the field,
the default is "on".

All ra attributes that are not explictly handled in
	trackDbCustom.c:trackDbAddInfo are added to the
	trackDb->settingsHash table.

Some settings used by various tracks:
    o exonArrows - if specified to draw strand arrows on exons.
    o itemAttrTbl - table used to color individual items in a track, selected
      by name and locations.  Currently works for genePred tracks.
    o url - If present puts up a link to an external URL on the details
      page.  The url includes everything else on the line after the first word.
      The string $$ will be replaced by the name of an item.   Examples:
      url http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?form=4&db=n&term=$$
      url http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=human&l=$$
      Additional replacement item strings can be:
	$T - database table name
	$S - chromomosome name (scaffold name on scaffold assemblies)
	$[ - chromStart location (zero relative)
	$] - chromEnd location
	$s - chromomosome name without chr prefix
			(or without scaffold_/Scaffold_ on scaffold assemblies)
	$D - database name
	$P - item name portion before first : in name
	$p - item name portion after first : in name up to next colon
    o urlLabel - Works with url attribute.  Replaces generic "outside link:" label
      with the given label.
    o idInUrlSql - Works with url attribute.  A snippet of SQL with a %s in it somewhere.
      The item name gets substituted in for the %s, and the SQL gets used in the current
      database returning a single string, which is substituted into the url in place of $$.
    o maxItems - Maximum number of items to be displayed individually in full
      mode.  If there are more items than this they will be drawn on top of
      each other on the last line.  In packed mode this refers to the number
      of lines rather than number of items.
    o directUrl - If present this will replace the "hgc" details page with 
      whats in the url.  The URL is formatted as a printf line including
      the following fields in this order:
         %s - item name
	 %s - chromosome name
	 %d - chromosome start position
	 %d - chromosome end position
	 %s - track name
	 %s - database name
      An example is:
	directUrl /cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=%s&hgg_chrom=%s&hgg_start=%d&hgg_end=%d&hgg_type=%s&db=%s
      Note that it is possible to only include the first field or first few
      fields.  The fields must be in the given order if present though.
    o hgsid - if present the hgsid=XXXXXX CGI variable will be appended to the
      end of the directUrl string.
    o dataVersion - prints out as the Data version on the details page
        (used chiefly by ENCODE)
    o origAssembly - prints out a message on the details page, indicating
        that the data was lifted from this assembly (used chiefly by ENCODE)
    o release <alpha | beta> - restricts inclusion of a trackDb entry 
        in the database.  TrackDb entries marked 'release beta' are 
        included in the trackDb database when 'make beta' 
        (or 'make strict') are used to create it.  Those marked 
        'release alpha' are included when 'make alpha' (or 'make') 
        is used.  This setting is used to avoid inadvertently changing 
        the configuration of an existing public track when it is 
        undergoing further development.  It provides a temporary 
        development-only version of the trackDb.  In this situation, 
        the developer should mark the existing trackDb entry (as on 
        the public server) 'release beta', and then add a parallel 
        entry marked 'release alpha' (the development version).  
        The existence of two entries should be noted in the pushQ.  
        Q/A will retire the duplicate entry and remove the release 
        labels when the track is published.
    o html - specifies alternate filename for track description. Should only
        be used when updating an existing track (used chiefly by ENCODE).
        in conjunction with the 'release alpha' setting.
    o scoreMin, scoreMax - sets the range used to color the track if 
        colored by score.  Allows use of the whole color range when data
        has scores with a smaller range than 0-1000.
    o baseColorUseCds {genbank,given,table,none} - For genePred or psl+cds
      (such as genbank mRNA, EST etc) tracks.  Specifies where CDS coordinates
      can be found (if any) so that codons can be drawn when viewing a
      sufficiently small region.  If `table' is specified, an additional
      parameter of a table name, in cdsSpec format, is required.
    o baseColorUseSequence {genbank,seq,extFile,none} - For genePred or psl
      tracks.  Specifies where item sequence can be found (if any) so that
      item sequence, or differences from genomic sequence, can be drawn when
      viewing a sufficiently small region.  If `extFile' is specified, two
      additional parameters are required, the name of the seq table followed
      by the name of the extFile table to use in looking up the sequence.
      These tables are loaded by hgLoadSeq.
    o baseColorDefaults {genomicCodons,itemBases,itemCodons,diffBases,
      diffCodons,none} - For tracks with CDS and/or sequence information.
      Specifies the default drawing mode.  itemBases, itemCodons, diffBases
      and diffCodons are applicable only if the track has sequence 
      (baseColorUseSequence).  genomicCodons, itemCodons and diffCodons 
      are applicable only if the track has CDS info (baseColorUseCds).
    o indelDoubleInsert {on,off} - For psl tracks.  If on, then highlight
      alignment gaps in both target and query using double lines (like 
      chain tracks).
    o indelPolyA {on,off} - For psl tracks that have sequence 
      (baseColorUseSequence).  If on, then highlight an apparent valid
      poly-a tail (a block of aaa's at the end of the item sequence, or 
      ttt's at the start, that are not aligned to the genome) by drawing
      a vertical green line.
    o indelQueryInsert {on,off} - For psl tracks that have sequence 
      (baseColorUseSequence).  If on, then highlight an insert in the 
      query only (alignment gap in the target only) by drawing an 
      orange vertical line.
    o showDiffBasesAllScales . - show bases differences for PSL tracks at all
      zoom levels.
    o showDiffBasesMaxZoom basesPerPixel - only show bases or codon zoomed
      difference annotations for PSL tracks at if currently zoomed at no more
      than basesPerPixel (a float). showDiffBasesAllScales should also be
      set to make this useful.
    o showIndelMaxZoom basesPerPixel - only show PSL annotations if currently
      zoomed at no more than basesPerPixel (a float).  Setting to 0.0 disables
      showing indels.
    o showCdsAllScales . - show CDS for PSL tracks at all zoom levels.
    o showCdsMaxZoom basesPerPixel - only CDS for PSL tracks at if currently
      zoomed at no more than basesPerPixel (a float). showCdsAllScales should
      be set and showDiffBasesMaxZoom should be set to a value not more
      than showCdsMaxZoom  to make this useful.

Note: We have a restriction on table names: Track names (i.e. table
names, but omitting any chr*_ prefix) should not contain any
underscores.  We use underscores in track table names to find sequence
name prefixes.


COMPOSITE TRACKS
================
Tracks that are somehow related can be grouped in a single "composite track",
using the "compositeTrack on" setting.  The track name for the
composite track is a placeholder, that is referenced in entries for the
subtracks.  The subtracks have a "subTrack" setting that references
the composite track name.  The composite track entry contains all
normal settings for the common track type if there is one.  

The subtrack track entries need contain only the short and long labels, 
they may optionally have a color setting and a priority within the 
composite track.  

If the subtracks lack color settings, and if color is set on the composite
track, the subtracks will be displayed with different colors in
a gradient from color to altColor.

To hide a subtrack initially, append "off" to the end of the
subtrack setting.

To include a subtrack of a different type, specify
the complete settings for the subtrack type, and use the "noInherit on"
trackDb setting.

For readability, please indent the subtrack entries in trackDb.ra by 4 spaces.

Subtrack Groups
---------------
To allow flexibility in user configuration of subtrack
visibility, subtracks can be grouped.  A subtrack group
(composite track subgroup) is defined with a trackDb setting,
in the format:

   subGroup# name label id1=val1 id2=val2 ...

where # is assigned 1-N based on the number of groups.
The "name" is an identifier for the group; the "label"
indicates how the group is labeled on the track configuration
screen.  Similarly, the "id" fields indicate possible
values for the group, while the "val" fields are how
they appear on the screen.

Subgroups for a subtrack are set as so:

    subGroups grp1=val1 grp2=val2 ...

Composite Track ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
----------------------------------

MATRIX or DIMENSIONS
--------------------
Composite Tracks can be organized into a matrix of X and Y Dimensions of 
subtracks.  This method of organization also may include a "Views" dimension.
The organization is achieved with a dimensions setting which refers to 
subgroups already defined. Example:
    subGroup2 cellType Cell_Type ES=ES MEF=MEF NP=NP EShyb=ES-hybrid
    subGroup3 factor Factor K4=H3K4me3 K9=H3K9me3 K20=H4K20me3 K27=H3K27me3 K36=H3K36me3 PAN=pan-H3 WCE=WCE RPOL=RPol-II
    dimensions dimensionX=cellType dimensionY=factor 
This will result in a composite track configuration page with a matrix of 
check boxes with 'Cell Types' along the X axis and 'Factors' along the Y.  All 
individual subtracks will be displayed below, but the matix of check boxes will 
allow easy selection by subgrouping. 

VIEWS
-----
A composite track may have subtracks with similar data subtracks which have 
different types or views. For instance, ChIP-seq tracks may cover raw aligns,
a signal track and called peaks.  The aligns may be 'bed 3', peaks 'bed 5 +' 
and signal 'wig'.  These views need different controls, though all signal 
subtracks may share the same controls (based upon subgroups).  This organization 
is achieved with the specialized subgroup "views". Example:  
    subGroup1 view Views HMM=Sites-HMM WIN=Sites-Windowing SIG=Signal_Densities ALN=Alignments
where each view (HMM,WIN,SIG,ALN) will be controlled by a separate drop down 
(hide,dense,...) and auxilary controls.  All subtracks for a given view must 
be of the same track type.  Currently this feature is only enabled for a composite 
using dimensions.

DIVIDERS
--------
In order to more easily recognize the organization of a large list of subtracks 
in a composite configuration page, dividers can be places between different 
groups of subtracks. Example:
    subGroup2 cellType Cell_Type ES=ES MEF=MEF NP=NP EShyb=ES-hybrid
    subGroup3 factor Factor K4=H3K4me3 K9=H3K9me3 K20=H4K20me3 K27=H3K27me3 K36=H3K36me3 PAN=pan-H3 WCE=WCE RPOL=RPol-II
    dividers cellType factor 
This will place a simple dividing line anytime the cellType or factor changes 
when listing the subtracks on the subtrack configuration page.  In addition, 
alternate groups will be displayed with slightly different background color.

HIERARCHY
---------
This setting allows one more means of visually organizing many subtracks on 
the composite track configuration page.  It is especially useful in easily 
distinguishing views which are likely to be different within a single group 
of subtracks.  Example:
    hierarchy view HMM=0 WIN=0 SIG=1 ALN=2
While a particular cell type and factor combination may be set of with dividers, 
between the dividers the HMM and WIN type subtracks have no indentation, while 
the signal track is indented by one and the alignment subtrack by two.

This example set up a composite track configuration page with an X and Y 
dimension matrix of check boxes for Cell Types by Factors.  Additionally, 
there are up to four views for each cellType/factor combination.  Each 
cellType/factor set will be set off by dividers and all subtracks belonging 
to the ALN view will be indented by two for easy visual identification.

SUPER TRACKS
================
Tracks can be organized in configuration groupings called 'super tracks'.
A 'super track' is just a container for a group of related tracks that
can be made visible or hidden as a unit.  There is an overall
description page displayed for the super track, and the super track
has a track control with special visibilities (hide/show) on the
hgTracks main page.  The tracks which are contained in the super track 
(super track members) do not have track controls on the hgTracks
main page.  To define super tracks and their members, use the
'superTrack' setting as follows:

 * Super track:   'superTrack on [show]'
 * Member tracks: 'superTrack <super> [vis]

The Super track entry is very limited -- just the
track name, labels, group, priority, and the superTrack setting.  
The optional 'show' field indicates that the default visibility 
for the super track is not hidden.

The Member track entry is a full trackDb entry -- either for a regular
track or a composite.  The <super> field gives the track name of
the super track for this member.   The optional 'vis' field 
indicates the default visibility for this track _only_ when it's a
member of a supertrack.  The normal visibility field applies
when the track is not in a super track.  (Note that a track can be 
configured to be viewable as a supertrack member or not -- it will
only be part of a super track if the super track to which it refers
is configured in the assembly trackDb).
