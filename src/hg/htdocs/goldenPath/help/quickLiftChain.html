<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Alignment Differences track shows mismatches and indels between the assembly from which the
track was QuickLifted and the current genome.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Visible tracks, custom tracks, and track hubs on the Browser graphic page are carried over (lifted)
to the new assembly using the <font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> tracks checkbox. When a single
track from a container track, such as a superTrack or composite, is lifted, the entire container
track is carried over to the new assembly.
</p>
<p>
<font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> tracks appear under a green
&quot;<font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> from ...&quot; group in the New assembly.
<font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> tracks can be removed by the 
<button>Disconnect</button> button. <font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> tracks have a green
left-side button bar in the Browser graphic, instead of the usual gray.
</p>
<p>
The &quot;Alignment Differences&quot; track displays liftOver differences using triangles and
lines; mousing over a triangle displays base-pair (bp) information. Lines and triangles are
color-coded as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insertions:
  <font color="#407F00">green</font></li>
  
  <li>Deletions:
  <font color="#00007F">blue</font></li>
  
  <li>Double-sided insertions:
  <font color="#7F7F7F">gray</font></li>
  
  <li>Mismatches:
  <font color="#FF0000">red</font></li>
</ul>
 <div class="text-center">

<p>Clicking a triangle provides additional information about the alignment.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
An alignment between two DNA sequences maps every nucleotide in one sequence to a nucleotide in
another sequence. By making and using whole-genome alignments (Kent et al., 2003),
genome annotations can be &quot;lifted&quot; to another assembly
(<a href="/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver" target="_blank">LiftOver</a>) in bulk, one track at a time.
<font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> is a tool that uses the same algorithm, but it maps
(&quot;liftOver&quot;) annotations on demand, in real-time, for all visible tracks. Only the
annotations in the currently visible region are lifted, so this is usually fast enough when
browsing a genome.
</p>

<p>
<font color="#008000">QuickLift</font> functionality depends on the availability of alignment files
(chains) that describe how sequences in one assembly correspond to another. The alignment files are
currently made at UCSC, but we are working on making the pipeline to align two genomes more widely
available.
