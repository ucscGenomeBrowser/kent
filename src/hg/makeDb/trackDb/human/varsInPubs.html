<H2>Description</H2>
<p>The tracks that are listed here contain genetic variants and links to scientific publications that 
mention them. The <i>Mastermind</i> track was created by Genomenom, a company that analyzes fulltext 
of publications with their own proprietary software with an unknown false
positive rate. The <i>AVADA</i> track was created in the Bejerano lab at
Stanford by J. Birgmeier also on fulltext papers, using sophisticated machine learning
methods and was evaluated to have a false positive rate of around 50% in their study.
The <i>PubTator rsIDs</i> track was created using 
<a href="https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/PubTator3/">PubTator 3 data</a>.
