<H2>Description</H2>
<P>Reference alignment of mouse genome vs. the human genome
constructed from the <EM>Mouse Translated Blat Alignments</EM>
track.
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The track is constructed by selecting the
best-scoring BLAT alignment for each aligned position in the genome.
Mouse insertions are included in the reference alignment when 
they follow the last base of a BLAT block, although this process
is not entirely perfected.
</P>
<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>This track is produced at UCSC. Mouse sequence data is provided by the 
Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium.
