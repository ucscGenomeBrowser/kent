<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track displays <A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu/dist/blastz.pdf" TARGET=_blank>blastz</A> alignments of the Feb. 2003 mouse draft
assembly to the human genome filtered to display only the best alignment for any
given region of the human genome. The track has an optional
feature that color codes alignments to indicate the mouse chromosomes from which 
they are derived. To activate the color feature,

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For blastz, we use 12 of 19 seeds and then score using: 
<PRE>
      A     C     G     T
A    91  -114   -31  -123
C  -114   100  -125   -31
G   -31  -125   100  -114
T  -123   -31  -114    91

O = 400, E = 30, K = 3000, L = 3000, M = 50
</PRE>
</P><P>
We then do a second pass at reduced stringency (7mer seeds and
MSP threshold of K=2200) to attempt to fill in gaps of up to about 10K bp.
Lineage specific repeats are abridged during this alignment.</P>

is done by UCSC's
