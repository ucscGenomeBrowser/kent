Transcriptome data for chromosomes 21 and 22 from <a

P. Kapranov et al.

TARGET = _BLANK>Large-Scale Transcriptional Activity in Chromosomes 21 and 22</A>.
<em>Science</em>, 296(5569):916-9).
In general, the data presented
is the perfect match - mis-match value. Different experiments were
normalized by setting the average value to be the same for each
chip. Replicates for different cell types were averaged together to
produce the data seen in "full" mode for each cell type. In dense
mode, or at the top of the track in full mode, &quot;Transcriptome&quot; displays
the maximum value over all experiments for that probe, the idea being
to paint as many transcribed regions as possible. 
<P>
To present a more
interpretable display when zoomed out, averages have been precalculated
over the chromosome at two different resolutions in addition to the
raw data. For example, when zoomed out, there may appear to be a peak at
the center of a gene rather than a signal at every exon. Zooming in
will reveal the &quot;raw&quot; data for that region.
<P>
NOTE: Affymetrix transcriptome annotations appear only on chromosomes 21 and 22.
