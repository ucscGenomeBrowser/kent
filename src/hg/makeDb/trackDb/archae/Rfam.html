Rfam is a joint project involving researchers based at the <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/" TARGET=_blank>Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/" TARGET=_blank>Washington University, St. Louis</A>. Rfam makes use of a large amount of available data, especially published multiple sequence alignments, and repackages these data in a single searchable and sustainable resource.
