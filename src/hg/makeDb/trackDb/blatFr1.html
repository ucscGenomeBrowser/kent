<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Fugu whole genome shotgun assembly was constructed with the JGI
assembler, JAZZ, paired end sequencing reads at a coverage of 5.7X
produced at JGI, Myriad Genetics, and Celera Genomics. All reads are
plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end-sequences, with the predominant coverage
coming from 2 kb insert plasmids. The assembly contains 20,379
scaffolds totaling 319 million base pairs; the largest 679 scaffolds
total 160 million base pairs. Gene modeling and analysis were
performed at JGI, Singapore, Cambridge, and the Institute for Systems
Biology.</P>

<P>The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>The alignments were done 
with <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A> in translated protein mode requiring 2 nearby 4-mer matches
to trigger a detailed alignment.  The $organism
genome was masked with RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder before 
running blat. </P>
