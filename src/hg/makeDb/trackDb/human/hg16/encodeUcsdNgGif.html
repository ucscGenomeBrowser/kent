<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays results of the following ChIP-chip (NimbleGen) 
gamma interferon experiments on HeLa cells:
<UL>
<LI> anti-H3K4me3, no gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> anti-H3K4me3, 30 minutes after gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> anti-RNA Pol2 in initiation complex, no gamma interferon</LI>
<LI> anti-RNA Pol2 in initiation complex, 30 minutes after gamma interferon</LI>
</UL></P>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide location analysis of trimethylated K4 histone H3 (H3K4me3,
or triMeH3K4) and RNA polymerase II was conducted with ChIP-chip
using chromatin extracted from HeLa cells induced for 30 minutes with
gamma interferon as well as uninduced cells. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from both induced and uninduced HeLa cells was separately
cross-linked, precipitated with different antibodies, sheared,
amplified and hybridized to an oligonucleotide tiling array produced by 
<A HREF="http://www.nimblegen.com/" TARGET=_blank>NimbleGen Systems</A>. 
The array includes non-repetitive sequences within the 44 ENCODE
regions tiled from NCBI Build 35 (UCSC hg17) with 50-mer probes at 38
bp interval.  Resulting genomic coordinates were translated to NCBI
Build 34 (UCSC hg16).</P>
<P>
Intensity values for biological replicate arrays were combined after
quantile normalization using 
<A HREF="http://www.r-project.org/" TARGET=_blank>R</A>.  
The averages of the quantile
normalized intensity values for each probe were then median-scaled and
loess-normalized using R to obtain the adjusted log R values.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates were used to generate the track for each
factor at each time point with the exception of RNA Pol2 uninduced,
for which only two biological replicates were used.</P>
