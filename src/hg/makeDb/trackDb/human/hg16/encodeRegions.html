<P>
This track depicts target regions for the NHGRI ENCODE project, which
is described in
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>The ENCODE Project: ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements</A>.
The long-term goal of this project is to identify all functional elements 
in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better understanding of human 
biology and disease. 
<P>
During the pilot phase, 44 regions comprising 30 Mb -- approximately 
1% of the human genome -- have been selected
for intensive study to identify, locate and analyze functional elements 
within the regions. These targets are being studied by a diverse public research
consortium to test and evaluate the efficacy of various methods, technologies, and
strategies for locating genomic features. The outcome of this initial
phase will form the basis for a larger-scale effort to analyze the entire human
genome.

regions were selected.
