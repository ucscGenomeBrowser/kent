<H2>Description</H2>

<P> This track depicts high throughput sequencing of long RNAs (&gt;200 nt) 
from whole cell 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=rnaExtract">RNA
samples</A> from 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=localization">tissues
or sub cellular compartments</A> from 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>
included in the ENCODE Transcriptome subproject. The overall 
goal of the ENCODE project is to identify and characterize all functional 
elements in the sequence of the human genome.
RNA-Seq was performed by reverse-transcribing an RNA sample into cDNA,
followed by high throughput DNA sequencing of the cDNA, which was done here
on Helicos&#0153; Genetic Analysis System (Harris et al;
<A target=_blank href="http://www.helicosbio.com/">http://www.helicosbio.com/</A>).

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
This is a multi-view track that provides the following views of the data:
<DL>
<DT><i>Alignments</i>
<DD>RNA-seq tag alignments.
<DT><i>Raw Signal</i>
<DD>Density graph (wiggle) of the number of reads overlapping a nucleotide
 in the genome.
</DL>
<P>To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that 
you wish to hide.
Color differences among the views are arbitrary. They provide a 
visual cue for 
distinguishing between the different cell types and compartments.</P>
<P>
Note that the strand of the RNA is not displayed in the track in the genome 
browser. The strand can be found in the 
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/wgEncodeHelicosRnaSeq/">
download file</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture
protocols</A>.
RNA molecules longer than 200 nt and present in RNA population isolated from
different subcellular compartments (such as cytosol, nucleus, polysomes and
others) were fractionated into polyA+ and polyA- fractions as described in
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/general/rnaExtracts.txt" TARGET=_BLANK>these
protocols</A>.
</P>
<P>
RNA was converted into first strand cDNA using a high excess of random hexamers
without prior fragmentation. Spurious second-strand cDNA synthesis could occur
under these conditions. The first strand cDNA molecules were tailed at the
3&prime; ends with polyA residues using terminal transferase and used 
directly for sequencing.
</P>
<P>
Filtered reads were aligned to the human genome using in-house and freely
available Helicos Alignment software indexDPgenomic
(<A target=_blank

with a minimum normalized alignment score of 4.5.
The normalized score was defined as following:
</P>
<PRE>
Score=(#matches*5-#mismatches*4)/length_read
</PRE>

<P>For example, in the following alignment:</P>

<PRE>
Tag Sequence CCTCCGTGTTGTTCCAGCC-CAGTGCTCGCAGG 
Ref Sequence C-TCCGTGTTGTTCCAGCCACAGTGCTCGCAGG
Length of alignment block: 33
Length of tag sequence: 32
Number of matches: 31
Number of errors: 2
Score: (31*5) - (2*4) = 155 - 8 = 147
Normalized score = 147/32 = 4.59375
</PRE>

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>
Known exon maps as displayed on the genome browser are confirmed by the 
alignment of sequence reads.
