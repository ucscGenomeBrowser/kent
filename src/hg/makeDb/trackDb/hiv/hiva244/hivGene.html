<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows known HIV-1 genes and regions based on data from 
<A HREF="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/hiv-db/mainpage.html" TARGET=_blank>
HIV Sequence Database</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Protein sequences from the 
<A HREF="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/REVIEWS/HXB2.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
Numbering Positions in HIV Relative to HXB2CG</A> 
page at HIV Sequence Database were aligned against the HIV-1 reference genome (HXB2) using 
BLAT. Those alignments spanning less than 70% length of the protein sequence 
were discarded. 
</P>
<P>
The variable regions (V2 and V5) of ENV are also marked according 
to the genomic position data found at

http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/combined_search_s_tree/help.html#region
</A>. 
</P>
<P>
The DNA sequences of the elements in the &quot;Genes and Regions&quot; track 
of the reference (HXB2) genome were aligned with the hivmn1(gp120) genome.  
The start and end positions of the resulting alignments were used to create this track.
