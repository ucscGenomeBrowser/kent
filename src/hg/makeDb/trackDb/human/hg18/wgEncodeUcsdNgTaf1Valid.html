<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays validation data from ChIP-chip experiments on 
four factors in IMR90 cells using a condensed array covering putative
TAF1 binding sites.  This track may be used to validate the whole genome 
scan shown in the <em>LI TAF1 Signal</em> and <em>LI TAF1 Sites</em> tracks.  
All four factors &mdash; Pol2, H3ac,
H3K4me2, and TAF1 itself &mdash; are associated with the start of transcribed
genes.  Thus, there should be a very strong correlation between the
signals shown in this track and the other tracks.
<P>
TAF1 is a component of TFIID, which is itself a 
component of the pre-initiation complex that assembles on promoter regions.  
Pol2, more fully known as RNA Polymerase II, is the enzyme responsible
for transcription of mRNA.  
The specific antibody against Pol2, 8WG16
from the Abcom catalog, binds specifically to the non-phosphorylated
form of Pol2 which is associated with the pre-initiation complex.
H3ac and H3K4me2 are forms of histone H3 that are associated with
transcriptionally-active chromatin.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For the whole genome scan, 
chromatin from IMR90 cells lines was cross-linked, precipitated with
TAF1 antibody (sc-735, Santa Cruz), sheared, amplified and hybridized
to 38 high-density oligonucleotide arrays (NimbleGen). These arrays
contain a total of 14,535,659 50-mer oligonucleotides, positioned at
every 100 base pairs throughout the human genome (UCSC hg16).  Using this
set of arrays, a total of 9,966 clusters of TAF1 binding sites were
identified.
<P>
To verify the binding of TAF1 to these sequences, a condensed array was
designed containing a total of 379,521 oligonucleotides to
represent the 9,966 putative TAF1 binding sequences plus 29 control
genomic loci at 100 bp resolution.  Using
these condensed arrays, two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments were performed with the antibodies against TAF1, Pol2,
acetylated histone 3 and dimethylated K4 histone 3.  A
total of 8,597 TAF1 binding regions, ranging in size from 400 bp to 9.8
Kbp, were confirmed by the TAF1 replicate experiments.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The peaks from genome scan experiments were verified using condensed
arrays, as described in the Methods section.
