<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows the alignments of selected full genome sequences in Genbank to the reference
genome.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Alignable regions are shown with thick lines. Small single-bp differences are highlighted with red
tickmarks on the thick lines. Alignable regions can be separated by non-alignable sequences with
thinner lines. Deletions are shown with single lines. Deletions that include at least one short
insertion are shown with double lines. Rearrangements are not shown directly, but duplications will
lead to two rows of thick lines, with the exact origin of the sequence shown on mouse over or by
clicking the sequence.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Sequences were aligned with BLAT and filtered with our command line tool pslReps at default
settings.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a> or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mpxvRivers/genbankAli/">the download server</a>.</p>
<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mpxvRivers/genbankAli/seqs.bb -chrom=NC_063383.1 -start=0 -end=100000 stdout</code>
