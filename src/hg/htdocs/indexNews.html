<font face="courier" size="3"><b>8 Apr. 2008 - Updated Cow Genome Browser Now Available</b></font><br>
		<P>
		The UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group has released a Genome 
		Browser and Blat server for the Oct. 2007 draft assembly of
 		the Cow genome <em>Bos taurus</em>. This assembly 
		(UCSC version bosTau4) was produced by the Baylor College of 
		Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC) as
		Baylor release Btau_4.0. </P>
		<P>
		The Btau_4.0 release was produced using the 
		<A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/4/721">Atlas</A>
		genome assembly system at BCM HGSC. 
		The sequencing strategy combined BAC shotgun reads with 
		whole genome shotgun reads from small insert libraries as well as 
		BAC end sequences. The assembly contains chromosomes 1-29 and X as 
		well as 11869 scaffolds (named chrUn.004.*). The mitochondrial 
		sequence (available in the browser as &quot;chrM&quot;) was obtained 
		from Genbank accession GI:60101824.</P>
		<P>
		The Btau_4.0 assembly was tested against available bovine sequence data
		sets (EST sequences and finished BAC sequences) for extent of coverage
		(completeness). When assembled contigs were tested, over 95% of the
		sequences in these data sets were found to be represented, indicating
		that the shotgun libraries used to sequence the genome were
		comprehensive. Of the 1.04 million EST sequences 95.0% were contained in
		the assembled contigs. Assuming the ESTs are uniformly distributed
		throughout the genome, the estimated genome size is 2.73Gb/95% = 2.87Gb.
		For detailed information on the sequencing and assembly techniques, 
		see the Baylor 
		<A HREF="http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/projects/bovine/">Bovine Genome Project</A> 
		web page.</P>
		<P>
		For a list of the chromosomes and scaffolds in this assembly, click 
		the "Sequences" link on the cow browser 
		<A HREF="../../cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=bosTau4">gateway</A> page.</P> 
		<P>
		Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are 
		available via the Genome Browser 
		<A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/bosTau4">FTP 
		server</A> or

		page. These data have 
		<A HREF="/goldenPath/credits.html#cow_use">specific 
		conditions for use</A>. The cow annotation tracks were generated 
		by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</P>
		<P>
		We'd like to thank Baylor College of Medicine for providing this
		assembly. The UCSC bosTau4 browser and documentation were
		produced by Hiram Clawson, Ann Zweig and Donna Karolchik.
		See the <A HREF="/goldenPath/credits.html#cow_credits">Credits</A>

		individuals who contributed to this release.
