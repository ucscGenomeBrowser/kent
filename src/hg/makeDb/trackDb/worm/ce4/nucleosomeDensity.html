<H3>Coverage of mononucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads</H3>
<P>
The plot represents the coverage by putative mononucleosomal cores 
(147 bps) from Micrococcal nuclease cleavage of C. elegans chromatin, 
using reads that mapped on the sense strand of the reference genome.

<H3>Coverage of mononucleosomal fragments, antisense strand reads</H3>
<P>
The plot represents the coverage by putative mononucleosomal cores 
(147 bps) from  Micrococcal nuclease cleavage of C. elegans chromatin 
using reads that mapped on the antisense strand of the reference 
genome.
