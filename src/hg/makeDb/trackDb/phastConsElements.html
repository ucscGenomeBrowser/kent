<H2>Description</H2> <P>
This track shows predictions of conserved elements 
based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phastCons).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
Best-in-genome pairwise alignments were generated for each species 
using blastz, followed by chaining and netting.  The pairwise alignments
were then multiply aligned using multiz.  
The resulting multiple alignments were then used to generate a Viterbi 
(maximum likelihood) path through a phylogenetic HMM, 
indicating likely conserved elements, by phastCons.
</P>
<P>
The phastCons program computes conservation likelihood based on a phylo-HMM, 
a type of probabilistic model that describes both the process of DNA 
substitution at
each site in a genome and the way this process changes from one site to the
next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996, Yang 1995, Siepel and Haussler 2003,
Siepel and Haussler 2004). In this case, a two-state phylo-HMM was used,
with a state for conserved regions and a state for non-conserved regions.
The value plotted at each site is the posterior probability that the
corresponding alignment column was "generated" by the conserved state of
the phylo-HMM.  These scores reflect the phylogeny (including branch
lengths) of the species in question, a continuous-time Markov model of the
nucleotide substitution process, and a tendency for conservation levels to
be autocorrelated along the genome (i.e., to be similar at adjacent sites).  
The general reversible (REV) substitution model was used, and variation of
substitution rates within each major category of sites (conserved and
non-conserved) was allowed for using Yang's (1994) discrete gamma model.
Note that, unlike many conservation-scoring programs, phastCons does not
rely on a sliding window of fixed size, so short highly-conserved regions
and long moderately conserved regions can both obtain high scores.
</P>
<P> 
PhastCons currently treats alignment gaps as missing data, which
sometimes has the effect of producing undesirably high conservation scores
in gappy regions of the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways
of improving the handling of alignment gaps.
