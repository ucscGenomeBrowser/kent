<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows best-in-genome chimpanzee/human alignments
based on the chimpanzee/human alignment net,  <em>i.e.</em>
the best chain for every part of the human genome.  
The human sequence used in this annotation is from
the July 2003 (hg16) assembly.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The track displays alignment scores and, when zoomed in to
the base level, the alignment itself. 
In the graphical display, the shade (in dense display mode) 
or height (in full display mode) of a vertical line indicates the score 
of the best chained and netted alignment at that location.  
Click on the track to view detailed information about the 
alignments in the currently displayed range of positions.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chains were derived from blastz and blat alignments, as described in the 
description page of the Human Chain track. These chains were merged, sorted, 
and netted to obtain the best alignments, as described in the Human Net 
track description.</P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
<P>
The chainNet, netSyntenic, and netClass programs were
developed at the University of California
Santa Cruz by Jim Kent.</P>
<P>
Blastz was developed at <A HREF="http://bio.cse.psu.edu"
TARGET=_blank>Pennsylvania State University</A> by
Minmei Hou, Scott Schwartz, Zheng Zhang, and Webb Miller with advice from
Ross Hardison.</P>
<P>
The browser display and database storage of the nets were made
by Robert Baertsch and Jim Kent.</P>
