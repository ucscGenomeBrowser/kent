<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows expression data from the GNF Gene Expression
Atlas 2. This contains two replicates each of 61 mouse 
tissues run over Affymetrix microarrays.  In full mode all tissues are
displayed.  In packed or dense mode averages of related tissues are shown.
As is standard with microarray data red indicates overexpression in the 
tissue, and green indicates underexpression.   You may want to view gene
expression with the Gene Sorter as well as the Genome Browser.</P>
