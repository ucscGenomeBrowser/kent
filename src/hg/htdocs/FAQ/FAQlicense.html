<h2>Licensing the Genome Browser or Blat</h2>
<h6>Do I need a license to install the Genome Browser or its databases on my own machine?</h6>
<p>
A license is required for local installation of the Genome Browser web interface or the
Blat and gfServer command-line alignment tool or webBlat interface. No license
is needed for a local installation by academic or nonprofit institution and for
personal use. The images produced by the Genome Browser and the raw data
displayed by the Genome Browser are freely available for both public and
commercial use with a few exceptions. Check the README.txt file in the assembly
download directory to view the use restrictions specific to
that release. All assemblies are available for free, and only some recommend 
citation of a publication. Some human genome annotation tracks cannot be
distributed by UCSC. For details on all licensing questions see <a
href="../license/">licensing page</a>.</p>

<h2>Downloading the Genome Browser source</h2>
<h6>Where can I download the source code and executables for the Genome Browser?</h6>
<p> 
The Genome Browser source code and executables are freely available for academic, nonprofit, and 
personal use. The command line tools and most of the library code is under an MIT open source license.
See <a href="#license1">Licensing the Genome Browser or Blat</a> for commercial 
licensing requirements of certain parts of our source code. The latest version
of the source code may be downloaded <a
href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip">here</a>.</p> 
<p>
See <a href="FAQblat.html#blat3">Downloading Blat source and documentation</a> for information on 
Blat downloads.</p>

<h2>Mirroring the Genome Browser</h2>
<h6>Our academic institution would like to install and run the Genome Browser and its databases 
on our local server. How do we do this? Is there a procedure for updating the data when new tables 
and assemblies are released?</h6>
<p> 
Non-commercial organizations are welcome to become a Genome Browser mirror site. A license is 
required for commercial local installation (mirroring) of the Genome Browser.
For detailed procedures on creating a full or partial mirror browser, see the
    <a href="../goldenPath/help/mirror.html">mirror site procedures
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting up a mirror with a customized data set</h2>
<h6>Is it possible to set up a local version of the Genome Browser that uses my own database 
rather than UCSC's?</h6>
<p> 
The default Genome Browser installation described on the 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/mirror.html">mirror page</a> includes all the databases and annotation tracks 
found on the UCSC Genome Browser website. It is possible to download a smaller data set to conserve 
space on your server. Or, if you prefer, you can load your local version of the Genome Browser with 
your own data rather than using the data supplied by UCSC.  Instructions for 
<a href="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Building_a_new_genome_database" 
target="_blank">building your own genome database</a> are located on our wiki site.</p>

<a href="mailto:genome-mirror@soe.ucsc.edu">genome-mirror</a> mailing list. <strong><em><span class="gbsWarnText">Messages

<h2>Minimum system requirements for a mirror</h2>
<h6>Are there any minimum system requirements for setting up my own mirror?</h6>
<p> 
There are a number of minimum software and hardware requirements that must be considered before 
trying to set up your own mirror. These requirements are described in detail in the 
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/mirrorManual.html#hardware-and-disk-space-requirements" 
target="_blank">Manual mirror installation manual</a>.</p>
