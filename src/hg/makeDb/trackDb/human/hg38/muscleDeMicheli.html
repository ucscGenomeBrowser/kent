<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32624006/"><em>A reference single-cell
transcriptomic atlas of human skeletal muscle tissue reveals bifurcated muscle
stem cell populations</em></a>. Muscle tissue was analyzed using single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and subsequent clustering distinguished 16
muscle-resident cell types based on their identified marker genes found in De
Micheli <em>et al</em>., 2020. Muscle samples were from surgically discarded
tissue taken from a wide variety of anatomical sites.</p>

<p> 
This track collection contains two bar chart tracks of RNA expression in the
human muscle where cells are grouped by cell type (Muscle Cells) or biosample
(Muscle Sample). The default track displayed is Muscle Cells.

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #707070;"></td><td>stem cell</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #FF8838;"></td><td>adipose</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #C000C0;"></td><td>muscle</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the Muscle Cells subtrack, where
the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the
cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Muscle samples were taken from 10 healthy donors of ages ranging from 41-81
years old from different sections of the face (F), trunk (T), and leg (L).
Excessive fat and connective tissue were removed from the muscle samples prior
to enzymatic dissociation. Next, libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics
3' v2 or v3 library kit and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. This
resulted in libraries with 200-250 million reads which were processed using Cell
Ranger version 3.1. In total, over 22,000 RNA transcriptomic profiles were
generated from all of the samples after quality control filtering. The single
cell transcriptomes from all 10 datasets were integrated using a scRNA-seq
integration method called Scanorama as described in the reference below.

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=muscle-cell-atlas">UCSC Cell Browser</a>. The
UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types.</p>
