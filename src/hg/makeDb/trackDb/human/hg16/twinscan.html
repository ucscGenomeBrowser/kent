<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Twinscan program predicts genes in a manner similar to Genscan, except that
Twinscan takes advantage of genome comparison to improve gene prediction
accuracy.  In the version of Twinscan used to generate this track, intronless 
copies of known genes are masked out before gene prediction, reducing 
the number of non-processed pseudogenes in gene models. More information and a
