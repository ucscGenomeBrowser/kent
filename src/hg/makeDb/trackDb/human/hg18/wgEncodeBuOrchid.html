<h2>Description</h2>

<P>
This set of tracks displays the predicted hydroxyl radical cleavage
intensity on naked DNA for each nucleotide in the genome.
Because the hydroxyl radical cleavage intensity is proportional to the solvent
accessible surface area of the deoxyribose hydrogen atoms 
(Balasubramanian <em>et al</em>., 1998), these tracks represent a structural 
profile of the DNA in the genome.</P>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<P>
These tracks may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different 
aspects of the displayed data. The graphical configuration options 
are shown at the top of the track description page.  For more information, 
click the 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" target="_blank">Graph
configuration help</a> link.</P>

<P>
In the full and pack display modes, positive intensity values are shown in <font color='992600'>
<B>red</B></font> and negative intensity values are shown in <font color='CC927F'><B>tan</B></font>.
In the squish and dense display modes, intensity is represented in grayscale (the darker
the shading, the higher the intensity).

<p>To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks that 
you wish to hide.</p>


 
<h2>Methods</h2>

<P>
Hydroxyl radical cleavage intensity predictions were performed using
an in-house sliding tetramer window (STW) algorithm.  This algorithm
draws data from the &middot;OH Radical Cleavage Intensity Database
(ORChID), which contains more than 150 experimentally determined cleavage
patterns.  The ORChID Version 1 predictions are performed on the + strand of the DNA sequence.
These predictions are fairly accurate, with a Pearson
coefficient of 0.88 between the predicted and experimentally
determined cleavage intensities.  

For ORChID Version 2, two predictions are performed, one on the + strand and the other on 
the - strand, and then the average of the predicted cleavage intensity for nucleotides in close proximity across the minor groove is presented.
For more details on the hydroxyl
radical cleavage method, see below for reference (Greenbaum <em>et al.</em> 2007). </P>



<h2>Verification</h2>

<P>
The STW algorithm has been cross-validated by removing each test
sequence from the training set and performing a prediction.  The
mean correlation coefficient (between predicted and experimental
cleavage patterns) from this study was 0.88. </P>
