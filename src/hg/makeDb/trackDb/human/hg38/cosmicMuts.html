<h2>Description</h2>
<p><a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/" target="_blank">COSMIC</a>, 
the "Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer," is an online database of somatic mutations found in 
human cancer. Focused exclusively on non-inherited acquired mutations, COSMIC combines information 
from a range of sources, curating the described relationships between cancer phenotypes and gene 
(and genomic) mutations. These data are then made available in a number of ways including here in the 
UCSC genome browser, on the COSMIC website with custom analytical tools, or via the
<a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download" target="_blank">COSMIC sftp server</a>.
Publications using COSMIC as a data source may cite our reference below.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
</p>
<p>The data in COSMIC are curated from a number of high-quality sources and combined into a single
resource. The sources include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed journal articles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cancer-genome-project" target="_blank">
CGP laboratories at the Sanger Institute, UK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/" target="_blank">TCGA data portal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dcc.icgc.org" target="_blank">The ICGC data portal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://p53.iarc.fr/" target="_blank">IARC p53 database</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Information on known cancer genes, selected from the <a
href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/" target="_blank">
Cancer Gene Census</a> is curated manually to maximize its descriptive content. 

<p>
UCSC was provided with the COSMIC annotations directly. The columns were reconfigured to match
our BED format, and 35 mutations were removed as they had illegal coordinates (start&gt;stop).
The resulting file was converted to a bigBed for display using the bedToBigBed utility.
</p>

<h2>Display</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dense - Indicate the positions where COSMIC mutations have been annotated in a single horizontal
track.</li>
<li>Squish - Indicate each mutation, in vertical pileups where appropriate, while minimizing 
screen space used.</li>
<li>Pack - Indicate each mutation with COSMIC mutation ID (COSVnnnnn).</li>
<li>Full - Show each mutation in detail, one per line, with COSM mutation ID (COSVnnnnn).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clicking into any item also displays the reference allele, alternate allele, and the
COSMIC legacy identifier (COSNnnnnn). Outlinks can also be found directly to COSMIC
for additional information.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The limited data available to UCSC  can be explored interactively 
with the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>,
or the <a href="/cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For automated analysis, the data may be
queried from our <a href="/goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>. Please refer to our
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/genome">mailing list archives</a>
for questions, or our <a href="/FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download36">Data Access FAQ</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>
The complete data can be explored and downloaded via the COSMIC 
<a href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic" target="_blank">website</a>.
