<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows conserved mammalian microRNA regulatory target sites in
the 3' UTR regions of Refseq Genes, as predicted by TargetScanS. </P> 

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Putative miRNA binding sites on mRNAs were identified using six-nucleotide 
seed sequences from all known miRNAs conserved among human, mouse, rat, 
dog and chicken.  These seed sequences were probed against the 3' end 
of mRNAs conserved over the five genomes.

this annotation, see Lewis <em>et al.</em> (2005).</P>
