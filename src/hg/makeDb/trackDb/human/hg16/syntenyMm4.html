<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows syntenous (corresponding) regions between human and mouse chromosomes. 
The Oct. 2003 (mm4) assembly of the mouse genome was used to produce this annotation.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
We passed a 100k non-overlapping window over the genome and - using the blastz best in mouse 
genome alignments - looked for high-scoring regions with at least 40% of the bases aligning 
with the same region in mouse. 100k segments were joined together if they agreed in direction and
were within 500 kb of each other in the human genome and within 4 Mb of each other in the mouse. 
Gaps were joined between syntenic anchors if the bases between two flanking regions agreed with 
synteny (direction and mouse location). Finally, we extended the syntenic block to include those 
areas.</P>
