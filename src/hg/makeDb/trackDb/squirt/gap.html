<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the position of gaps &mdash; represented by <em>N</em>s &mdash; within 
the <em>C. intestinalis</em> assembly. Gaps of 50 or more bases were most 
likely introduced by the JGI JAZZ assembler.</P>
<P>
For a discussion of gaps and the JAZZ assembler see 
Dehal, P. <em>et al.</em> (2002) in the References section below.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Gaps are represented by boxes. If the relative order and orientation of 
the contigs on either side of the gap is known from mRNA, ESTs, or paired BAC 
end reads, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap, indicated by a white line drawn 
through the box. The display must be sufficiently zoomed in to view this 
feature. In full display mode, the item label indicates the type of gap and 
whether the gap is bridged.</P>
