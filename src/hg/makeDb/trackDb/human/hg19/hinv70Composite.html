<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alignments of full-length cDNAs that were used as the basis
of the <a href="http://h-invitational.jp/hinv/ahg-db/index.jsp"
target="_blank">H-Invitational Gene Database</a> (HInv-DB version 7.0).
This is the version 7.0 update from March 2010.
</p>

<p>
HInv-DB entries describe the following entities:
<ul>
<li>gene structures</li>
<li>functions</li>
<li>novel alternative splicing isoforms</li>
<li>non-coding functional RNAs</li>
<li>functional domains</li>
<li>sub-cellular localizations</li>
<li>metabolic pathways</li>
<li>predictions of protein 3D structure</li>
<li>mapping of SNPs and microsatellite repeat motifs in relation with orphan
diseases</li>
<li>gene expression profiling</li>
<li>comparative results with mouse full-length cDNAs gene structures</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
To cluster redundant cDNAs and alternative splicing variants within the H-Inv
cDNAs, a total of 41,118 H-Inv cDNAs were mapped to the human genome using
the mapping pipeline developed by the Japan Biological Information Research
Center (JBIRC). The mapping yielded 40,140 cDNAs that
were aligned against the genome using the stringent criteria of at least 95%
identity and 90% length coverage. These 40,140 cDNAs were clustered to 20,190
loci, resulting in an average of 2.0 cDNAs per locus. For the remaining 978
unmapped cDNAs, cDNA-based clustering was applied, yielding 847 clusters.
In total, 21,037 clusters (20,190 mapped and 847 unmapped) were identified
and integrated into H-InvDB. H-Inv cluster IDs (e.g. HIX0000001) were
assigned  to these clusters. A representative sequence was selected from each
cluster and used for further analyses and annotation.

report by the H-Inv Consortium (see References section).

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
The H-InvDB is hosted at the Biomedicinal Information Research Center (BIRC),
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in
Japan.  The human-curated annotations were produced during invitational
annotation meetings held in Japan during the summer of 2002, with a follow-up
meeting in November 2004.  Participants included 158 scientists
representing 67 institutions from 12 countries.
</p>

<p>
The full-length cDNA clones and sequences were produced by the
Chinese National Human Genome Center (CHGC),
the Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ/MIPS),
Helix Research Institute, Inc. (HRI),
the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo (IMSUT),
the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (KDRI),
the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC/NIH) and the
Full-Length Long Japan (FLJ) project.
