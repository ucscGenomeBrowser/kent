<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows which genome regions are more or less accessible to next
generation sequencing methods that use short, paired-end reads.  It summarizes whole
genome sequencing data from Phase 3 of the
<a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/"
target="_blank">1000 Genomes Project</a> and shows two
levels of stringency:  &quot;pilot&quot; stringency regions (see below) cover 94.5%
of non-N bases in the genome (excluding alternate haplotype sequences and unplaced contigs;
95.9% on autosomes)
and &quot;strict&quot; regions cover 75.5% (76.9% on autosomes).  Each site which meets
&quot;strict&quot; criteria also passes the &quot;pilot&quot; criteria.
</p>

<p>
This track does <b><i>not</i></b> show a mask of regions in which variant calls can
or cannot be made.
Some 1000 Genomes Phase 3 variant calls are in regions that do not meet the
&quot;strict&quot; criteria.
Phase 3 variant calls are filtered using various tools such as the
<a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=39"
target="_blank">Variant Quality Score Recalibrator</a> (VQSR)
method (implemented in the
<a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/"
target="_blank">Genome Analysis Toolkit</a> (GATK))
without regard to the thresholds applied here.
VQSR and similar tools assess the evidence for variation at sites where a variant is called,
but say nothing about the remaining sites.
The 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 variant calls combine information from low coverage sequencing,
exome sequencing and array genotyping for improved sensitivity and specificity.
The coverage masks are based on low coverage sequencing only.
</p>

<p>
These regions will be useful for (a) comparing accessibility using current technologies
to accessibility in the 1000 Genomes Pilot Project, and (b) population genetic
analyses (such as estimates of mutation rate) that must focus on genomic regions
with very low false positive and false negative rates.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The total depth of mapped sequence reads, the average mapping quality score
and the fraction of reads with mapping quality zero (meaning that this read maps
equally well to more than one location in the genome) are tabulated from
1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 .bam files.
This combines whole genome sequence data from 2,504 individuals,
giving a genome wide average depth of coverage of 17,920 reads.
Both &quot;pilot&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; tracks are .bed file conversions of the
&quot;pass&quot; regions from
<a href="ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/"
target="_blank">.fasta mask files</a>.
See the
<a href="ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/accessible_genome_masks/README.accessible_genome_mask.20140520"
target="_blank">README file</a> in that directory and
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7571/extref/nature15393-s1.pdf"
target="_blank">Supplementary Information</a> (section 9.2)
of 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, <i>et al.</i> (2015) for more details.
</p>

<p>
The &quot;pilot&quot; criteria require a depth of coverage between 8,960 and 35,840 inclusive
(between one-half and twice the average depth) and that no more than 20% of
covering reads have mapping quality zero.  These are equivalent to the criteria
used for analyses in the 1000 Genomes Pilot paper (2010).  The &quot;strict&quot; criteria
require a depth of coverage between 8,960 and 26,880 inclusive, no more than 0.1%
of reads with mapping quality zero, and an average mapping quality of 56 or greater.
This definition is quite stringent and focuses on the most unique regions of the
genome.
Since approximately
one-half of 1000 Genomes Project individuals are males, the depth of coverage
is generally lower on the X chromosome.  Coverage thresholds on the X chromosome were
adjusted by a factor of 3/4 and on the Y chromosome by a factor of 1/2.

<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>, or the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in a bigBed file that can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/1000Genomes/phase3/" target="_blank">download server</a>.
The underlying data files for this track are called
<tt>20141020.pilot_mask.whole_genome.bb</tt> and <tt>20141020.strict_mask.whole_genome.bb</tt>. 
Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt> 
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled binary
for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>. 
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, for example:<br> 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/1000Genomes/phase3/20141020.strict_mask.whole_genome.bb -chrom=chr6 -start=0 -end=1000000 stdout</tt>
