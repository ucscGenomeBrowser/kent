<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The four subtracks in this annotation correspond to replication
timing categories for DNA synthesis.  Replication is segregated
into early specific (Early), mid specific (Mid), late specific (Late),
and non-specific (PanS).  The first three categories correspond
to regions that replicated in a time point-specific manner; 
the latter category encompasses regions that replicated in a 
temporally non-specific manner.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved isolation of
replication products from HeLa cells synchronized at the G1-S boundary by
thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells released from the block were labeled
with BrDu at every two-hour interval of S-phase and DNA was isolated from 
them. The heavy-light (H/L) DNA representing the pool of DNA replicated during 
each two-hour labeling period was separated from unlabeled DNA by double cesium 
chloride density gradient centrifugation. The purified H/L DNA was 
then hybridized to a high-density genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised 
of all unique probes within the ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The time of replication of 50% (TR50) of each microarray probe was
calculated by accumulating the sum over the five time points and
linearly interpolating the time when 50% was reached.  Each probe
was also classified as temporally specific or non-specific based on
whether or not at least 50% of the accumulated signal appeared in a single
time point.</P>
<P>
The TR50 data was then analyzed within a 20 kb sliding window 
to classify regions as specific versus non-specific based
on the ratio of specific to non-specific probes within the window.
Specific regions were further classified as early, mid, or late
replicating based on the average TR50 of specific probes within the
window.  The resulting regions form a non-overlapping segregation
of the replication data into the four given categories of
replication timing.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The replication experiments were completed for two biological sets
in the HeLa-adherent cell line.</P>
