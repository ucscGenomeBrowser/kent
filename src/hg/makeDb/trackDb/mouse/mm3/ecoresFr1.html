<H3> Description </H3>
This track shows Evolutionary Conserved Regions computed by the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10835645&dopt=Abstract" TARGET=_BLANK>
Exofish</A> program at <A HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr" TARGET=_BLANK>Genoscope</A>.
Each singleton block corresponds to an "ecore"; two blocks connected by a thin line 
correspond to an "ecotig", a set of colinear ecores in a syntenic region.  

<H3> Methods </H3>
Genome-wide sequence comparisons were done at the protein-coding level between the genome sequences
of mouse, <I>Mus musculus</I>, and Fugu (Japanese pufferfish), <I>Takifugu 
rubripes</I>, to detect evolutionarily conserved regions (ECORES).
The sequence versions used in the comparison were 
Mouse (February 2003) and Fugu (August 2002).
