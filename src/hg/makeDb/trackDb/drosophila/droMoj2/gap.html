<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps between contigs in the scaffolds (also known 
as &quot;supercontigs&quot;) of this assembly of the <em>$Organism</em>
genome.
The assembly was produced by
Agencourt Bioscience (now a part of <a href="http://www.beckmangenomics.com" target="_blank">Beckman Coulter Genomics</a>) using
the <A HREF="https://www.broadinstitute.org/science/programs/genome-biology/computational-rd/computational-research-and-development" 
TARGET=_BLANK>Arachne</A>
assembler.  Where the assembly indicated a negative gap size, a gap size of
25 base pairs was substituted in by 
<A HREF="http://www.eisenlab.org" TARGET=_BLANK>Michael Eisen</A> at Berkeley.
All gaps are of type &quot;contig&quot; and are bridged by paired-read evidence.
