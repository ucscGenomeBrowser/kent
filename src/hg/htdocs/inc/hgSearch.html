    <h2>Using the Genome Browser Search</h2>
    <!-- <div class="headerSpacer"></div> -->
    <p>
    The Genome Browser search page shows matches to words in track data, track
    names and/or descriptions, help docs, and public hub track names and/or
    descriptions. Clicking on a match does one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>navigates to the Genome Browser track display at the location of the track item</li>
      <li>navigates to the help page matching the search term</li>
      <li>navigates to the configuration page for the track/public hub track</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    The tree to the left of the search results shows a high-level view of the types of
    categories a search result belongs to and how many matches is available in each category.
    The checkboxes in the tree can be used to quickly hide or show all the matches belonging
    to that category, and in the case of matches to track items, hide or show all of the
    matches to the subcategories as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    Search results belong to one of 5 different categories, UCSC Genes/GENCODE genes, items
    in tracks, track names, public hub track names, and help documentation. Each category
    is explained in more detail below.
    </p>

    <p>
    All categories show the first 10 hits by default, and can expand up to 500 hits per category. Note that there may be more than 500 relevant hits per category, in which a note will show up as "Show 490 more (out of "X" total)", where X is the total number of hits available.
    <h3>UCSC Genes/GENCODE Genes</h3>
    <p>
    Matches to this category shows matches to transcripts in the knownGene track from the
    genome browser, if it is available for the current assembly. Along with a link to the
    genome browser at the locus of the gene, there is also a short description with the
    search terms bolded to show why the search terms matched this gene. Up to 500 hits to
    this category can be viewed at once, with only the top 10 most relevant matches being
    shown by default.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that as not all assemblies have a UCSC Genes/GENCODE Genes track, matches to this
    category will not be available for all organisms.
    </p>
    <h3>Assembly Track Data Items</h3>
    <p>
    Matches to this category shows matches to items in tracks that match the search terms.
    In the result list on the right, each track gets its own section and is collapsible.
    Only the first 10 matches are shown, although up to 500 can be displayed if there are
    that many. Note that there may be more than 500 relevant matches but only 500 can be
    shown on the page at one time.
    </p>

    <p>
    The tree on the left can be used to quickly display only hits to tracks of interest. The
    tree checkboxes can be used to collapse uninteresting track results. Note that tracks are
    organized by track group (ie Mapping and Sequencing, Genes and Genes Predictions, etc),
    and then their track database hierarchy (such as composite or super tracks). If a track
    hub is connected and the hub provider has enabled searching on the hub tracks, they will
    also be searched and present as a separate group.
    </p>
    <h3>Assembly Track Names/Descriptions</h3>
    <p>
    This category shows matches to track names and description pages for those tracks hosted
    at UCSC. Use this category to discover new tracks of interest.
    </p>
    <h3>Public Hubs</h3>
    <p>
    This category is similar to the above category except limited to "Public Hubs". As public
    hubs are externally hosted, this data may be out of date with the current state of the hub.
    Hubs are currently re-indexed weekly. Matches are only shown for the currently connected
    assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Clicks on these results takes one to the track configuration page for the matching hit
    on the currently connected assembly.
    </p>
    <h3>Help Pages</h3>
    <p>
    This category shows matches to the various help pages on the site. Clicking on one of these
    hits takes one to the help page.
