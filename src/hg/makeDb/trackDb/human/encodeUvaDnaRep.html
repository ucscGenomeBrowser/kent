<H2> Description </H2>
<P>
The five subtracks in this annotation correspond to five different time points
relative to the start of the DNA synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle.  
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Regions that are replicated during the given time interval are shown in green.  
Varying shades of green are used to distinguish one subtrack from another.
To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you 
wish to hide.</P>

<H2> Methods </H2>
<P>
The experimental strategy adopted to map this profile involved isolation of 
replication products from HeLa cells synchronized at the G1-S boundary by 
thymidine-aphidicolin double block. Cells released from the block were
labeled with BrdU at every two-hour interval of the 10 hours of S-phase and
DNA was isolated from them. The heavy-light(H/L) DNA representing the pool of 
DNA replicated during each two-hour labeling period was separated from the
unlabeled DNA by double cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation.
The purified heavy-light DNA was then hybridized to a high-density 
genome-tiling Affymetrix array comprised of all unique probes within the 
ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
The raw data generated by the microarray experiments was 
processed by computing the enrichment of signal in a particular 
part of the S-phase relative to the entirety of the S-phase (10 hours).
High confidence regions (P-value = 1E-04) of 
replication were mapped by applying the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test in a sliding
window of size 10 kb using the standard Affymetrix data analysis tools
and the April 2003 (hg15) version of the human genome assembly. 
These coordinates were then mapped to the July 2003 (hg17) assembly by UCSC
using the liftOver tool.</P>

<H2> Verification </H2>
<P>
The submitted data are from two biological experimental sets.  Regions of
significant enrichment were included from both of the biological replicates.
