<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows Rat quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from the 
<A HREF="http://rgd.mcw.edu" TARGET=_BLANK>Rat Genome Database (RGD)</A> 
that have been coarsely mapped by UCSC to the $Organism genome using 
stringently filtered cross-species alignments.  
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a polymorphic locus that contains alleles
which differentially affect the expression of a continuously distributed 
phenotypic trait. Usually a QTL is a marker described by statistical 
association to quantitative variation in the particular phenotypic trait that
is thought to be controlled by the cumulative action of alleles at multiple 
loci.</P>
<P>
For a comprehensive review of QTL mapping techniques in the rat, see Rapp, 2000. </P>
<P>
To map the Rat QTLs to $Organism, UCSC's chained and netted blastz
alignments of Rat to $Organism were filtered to retain only those with
high chain scores (&gt;=500,000).  This removed many valid-but-short
alignments and in general retained only very long chains (&gt;10,000,
usually &gt;100,000 bp), so that only large regions could be mapped.  This
choice was made because QTLs in general are extremely large and
approximate regions.  After the alignment filtering, UCSC's liftOver
program was used to map Rat regions to $Organism via the filtered
alignments.</P>
<P>
To get a sense of how many genomic rearrangments between Rat and
$Organism are in the region of a particular Rat QTL, you may want to
view the $Organism Nets track in the Rat $o_date genome browser.  
In the position/search box, enter the name of the Rat QTL of interest.
