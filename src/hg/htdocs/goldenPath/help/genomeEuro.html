	<h1>Using genome-euro</h1>
	  
    <div class="sectionContent">

                <p>
                Genome-euro is an official European mirror site of the UCSC Genome Browser, located at
                <a href="http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu</a>.
                The server is physically located at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld
                <a href="http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/" target="_blank">
                Center for Biotechnology</a> in Bielefeld, Germany, and is administered by UCSC.
                Genome-euro is meant to be an alternate, faster access point for those Browser users
                who are geographically closer to central Europe than to the western United States.
                </p>

                <p>
                When European users browse to the U.S. server (and conversely, when U.S. users browse to
                the European server) and click the "Genomes" or "Genome Browser" menu item, they will receive
                a notification at the top of the window that they have been redirected to the more
                geographically-appropriate server.  At this point, one of two things can happen:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>The user can accept the fact that they have been redirected and proceed normally.</li>
                  <li>The user can click the provided link back to the original server. When this occurs, a
                      cookie is created in the user's Internet browser remembering this choice and in the
                      future, no automatic redirection will occur.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                The user may also manually select a server at any time by mousing over the "Mirrors" menu item,
                illustrated below.  Note that manually selecting a server will also create a cookie that will
                disable automatic redirection. Automatic redirection can be re-enabled by clearing cookies.
                </p>

                <p>
                <center><img src="../../images/server_selector.jpg"></center>
                </p>

                <p>
                Any custom tracks created on the U.S. server will not be available on genome-euro and vice versa.
                If you would like these tracks to be available on the alternate server, they will need to be manually
                transferred. For instructions on how do to this, please see the
                <a href="hgTracksHelp.html#transfer">custom tracks</a> documentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                Many thanks to the folks at the Universit&auml;t Bielefeld
                <a href="http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/" target="_blank">Center for Biotechnology</a>
                for hosting this server.
                </p>
