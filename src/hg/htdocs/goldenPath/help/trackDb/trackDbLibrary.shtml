<!-- trackDb documentation Library
  In order to reference trackDb type and setting descriptions in multiple documents, this library
  file is designed to hold the one definitive copy of the setting or type description.

  ALWAYS VIEW trackDbTestBlurbs.html AFTER MODIFYING THIS FILE !!!!!!!

  How to add/maintain this documentation:
  There are 2 essential parts to trackDb*.html DOCS: I) this LIBRARY and II) the HTML PAGES.

  I) This LIBRARY consists of "DIV"s that contain blurbs descibing settings and types.
     Example:
        <DIV class="someSetting"><span class="types bed bigBed"></span>
        <div class="format"><code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code></div>
            <P>Both <code>bed</code> and <code>bigBed</code> type tracks
            use <code>someSetting</code> in combination with
            <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A> to accomplish something.</P>
            <P><B>Example:</B></P>
            <pre>   someSetting 100</pre>
        </DIV>
  - Each "DIV" should have the class=<setting>.  There MUST be only one uniquely classed DIV for
    each setting or type.  NOTE: use class NOT id so that anchor links work.
  - Each "setting DIV" must contain a class="types..." SPAN that lists the track types that
    this blurb/setting is relevant to.
  - > Each setting DIV MUST contain a class="format" DIV that gives the exact format of the
      setting, wrapped in <code>.
  - > The setting DIV should also contain an <B>Example:</B> followed by a preferably real life
      example wrapped in <PRE> tags.  Remeber multi-line <PRE> text will include the indents
      found in this file!
  - > Any setting or code that is not made into a link should be wrapped with <code> tags.
  - > Some settings may refer to other settings and your blurb should include a link to the other
      setting, especially if the setting bulrb will appear at some distance in the document.
      Since all settings should have an anchor by the setting name, a "jumpTo" link to
      visibility setting can be accomplished as:
          <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A>
      which is identical to
          <A HREF="#visibility">visibility</A>
  - "Type setting DIVs" are the same as other setting divs except that, there should be a seperate
    Examples DIV with class type_example (e.g. <DIV class="bed_example">).
  - > These "example DIVs" should also have a class=format" DIV but in this case it contains a
      title to the example:  <div class="format"><B>Examples of item base types:</B></div>.
  - > Exmples should make use of <PRE> tags and preferrably multiple real live examples.
  - Document introductions and section introductions may also be shared by multiple documents
    and therefore may be included here as "intro DIVs" as: <DIV class="bed_intro">.
  - > intro DIVs do not contain a class="format" DIV.
  - Use trackDbTestBurbs.html to test blurbs you add or modify.
  HINT: It is the class=<setting> that ties things togther.  If there is a need for multiple
  descriptions of the same setting, then create multiple DIVs with different classes as:
    <DIV class="parent"> and and <DIV class="parent_view">.

  II) Document HTML PAGES should include this trackDbLibrary.html with server side includes
  and wrapped in <DIV ID="library"> tags.
  - Documents may differ, but using trackDbDoc.html as the quintisential example, the setting
    documentation is organized into tables by trackDb "type", so that settings are documented in
    the context of their use.  The (usually) single cell rows contain the settings.
    Settings table row example:
        <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD class="someSetting"><A name="someSetting"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
            <div class="format"><code>someSetting</code></div>
        </TD></TR>
  - - Any setting may be referenced multiple times.  To reference a setting DIV, place it in
      a table cell that contains class=<setting> and an "image toggle details" tag.
      When the user clicks on the [+] button toggle image, the library will be read to render
      the <DIV class="<setting>">.
  - - The table cell should also contain the "format" DIV, so the user knows what they are
      requesting.  The format containd in the doc will be replaced by the one in the
      library at toggle, so the library has the final word on format.  In the example,
      <code>someSetting</code> is replaced by <code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code>.
  - - The first (or best) reference to your library div should contain the one and only
      "named anchor" for that setting <A name="<setting>">.  This named anchor MUST be at
      the beginning of the cell, before the toggle image. NOTE: the named anchor for a type is
      often put at the start of the table that describes it.
  - - Related settings can be grouped as a set of related rows by adding the "related" class
      to the TR.  The first such related row must have class="related1st" as:
          <TR class="related1st" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="directUrl"> ...
          <TR class="related" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="hgsid">
      Related rows toggle as a set and have faint dividers between them.  The final setting DIV
      of a related set should have an example for the whole set.
  - Each table of settings for a particular type or set of types should end in an example. The
    Example cell behaves similarly to the setting cells, except the row has a special class:
        <TR class="examples" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="bed_example">
            <A name="bed_Examples"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
  - Each table should be proceeded headed with an introduction as:
        <THEAD><TR><TD><DIV ID="bed_intro" class="intro"></DIV></TD></TR></THEAD>
    All DIVs of class "intro" will be read from the library (by ID) and rendered when the
    page is first loaded.
  - Each table of settings can begin with a "toggle oneSection" image as:
      <TR VALIGN=TOP><TH><IMG class='toggle oneSection'> bed/bigBed - Item or region track settings
    This toggle will toggle all cells in the table.
  - The document as a whole should contain a "toggle all" image as:
        <IMG class='toggle all' />&nbsp;<I>Open/close all details.</I>
    which will open and close all the table cells.
  - The document may include a "self-assembling table of contents".  This is table will be built if
  - - There is an empty table of ID="toc": <TABLE class="settingsTable" id="toc"></TABLE>
  - - The $(document).ready() event calls: tdbDoc.tocAssemble(<delay>,[<exclude>]);
  - - - delay (ms) greater than zero will delay the start of the assembly for user responsiveness
  - - - <exclude> can be a comma separated list of settings (class=<setting>) to exclude
  - - The table will fill in a header and a row per settingsTable td that contains a "format" div.
      The table will include 3 columns: setting, types that call it (from the "types" span) and
      the ID of the table that includes the setting.  Use this ID to be descriptive:
      ID="Signal_Track_Settings".
  Additional text, table of contents, etc. may best be built into the document, not the library.
  Please make use of "named anchors" and "jumpTo" anchors.  Add uniquely named anchors and directly
  reference those anchors as needed.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Track Database Definition</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in">How to declare Dataset Display Settings
                                        in the Genome Browser</H2>
    <P>This document is
    intended to describe how to declare dataset display characteristics
    in the Genome Browser through trackDb settings.   Introducing new
    datasets for display in the Browser requires declaring the location
    and format of the data and defining initial display characteristics.
    In many cases, you may need to choose how the displayed data (aka
    "track") may be selected and configured.  These settings
    are declared in a simple text file format and stored in a database
    called the "track database",  or trackDb for short.</P>

    <P>The text file format
    for trackDb settings follow the simple "ra" rules which
    establish a "record" as a set of related settings in a
    "stanza" delimited by blank lines.  The first line of
    each stanza typically establishes the "key".  Each line
    in a stanza will contain a single word "setting" name and
    one or more words or numbers that follow are the setting's
    "value".   All trackDb stanzas are keyed by "track"
    and most will have certain common settings followed by track specific
    settings.  Here is an example:</P>

    <pre style="margin-left:3em;">
        track myFirstTrack
        type bed 6
        shortLabel Example Data
        longLabel The data in this track is format "bed 6".
    </pre>

    <div class="hintBox" style="margin-left:2em; width:580px;">
        <I><B>Inside hint:</B></I><I> The ra file
        format supports  '<code>\</code>' continuation characters.  If the
        setting is long or complex, break it into several lines using
        terminating '<code>\</code>' characters to make it more readable.
        </I>
    </div>

    <P>Every track should have
    these four settings.  The key of this track (<code>myFirstTrack</code>)
    is the name of the dataset.  If the data is loaded into a MySQL
    table then the track name is almost always the table name.  If the
    data is in one of the remote indexed file types (e.g. <code>bigwig</code>, <code>bam</code>,
    etc.)  then the name is typically the root file name.  However, this
    is a key to the track so it must be unique within the Genome Browser.
        (Data hubs need only declare track names unique to their hub.)
    After the "track" key, the most important setting for
    defining a track is the <code>type</code>.  This tells the Browser
    what format the data is in and defines how to display it and what
    options are available for fine control of that display.
    </P>

    <P>Further description of each type can be found
    below.  In many cases the type setting includes additional
    parameters to further specify the data format.  Further, some
    track types have additional setting requirements, to be discussed
    below.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B>
    </P>
    <pre>   type bed 6 +</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="shortLabel"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>shortLabel</code></div>
    <P>Required: <span class="red">Yes</span></P>
    <P>The "short label" is used in a
    number of places in the Browser to identify the track.  For
    example, the short label is seen on the side of the track when it
    is displayed in the Browser image.  This label must be brief and
    is limited to 17 printable characters.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B>
    </P>
    <pre>   shortLabel Human mRNAs</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="longLabel"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>longLabel</code></div>
    <P>Required: <span class="red">Yes</span></P>
    <P>The "long label" is also used in
    numerous places in the Browser to identify a track.  For instance,
    the long label is seen above the track data when it is displayed
    in the Browser image.  This label should be descriptive enough to
    allow users to uniquely identify the track within the Browser.  It
    is limited to 76 printable characters.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   longLabel Human mRNAs from GenBank</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="visibility"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>visibility</code></div>
    <P>Required: No</P>
    <P>Visibility (a.k.a "display mode")
    is set to 1 of 4 modes that a track will be displayed in, within
    the Browser image.  This setting is almost always dynamically
    customizable by each user.  The exact display for each mode
    depends upon the track's type and not all types support all 4
    display modes.</P>
    <P>Possible settings:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI><code>hide</code>: DEFAULT. The track will not be seen until a user
    requests it.</LI>
    <LI><code>dense</code>: the track will be displayed within a single line or
    ribbon.  Often this means multiple items are summarized and long
    labels are not seen.</LI>
    <LI><code>squish</code>: the track's data may be squished into an even
    thinner ribbon than in dense mode.</LI>
    <LI><code>pack</code>: items are displayed individually but as much vertical
    white space as possible is removed.</LI>
    <LI><code>full</code>: each item will be seen as a separate line in the
    Browser image, graphed signals may be seen in varying heights.</LI>
    </UL>
    <P>As always, experiment with this setting to see
    what it does to your track type.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B>
    </P>
    <pre>   visibility dense</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="html"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>html</code></div>
    <P>Required: No</P>
    <P>The html refers to a file that contains the
    complete description of a track in html format.  The path of this
    file name is relative to the path of the trackDb file.  The
    ".html" suffix is implied.  This description should contain
    several sections:</P>
    <P><B>Description</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.26in; margin-right: 0in">One
    to three sentences describing the contents of the track and what
    it attempts to show.  The description can include additional
    paragraphs giving further details and can include links to outside
    sources.</P>
    <P><B>Display Conventions and Configuration</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.26in; margin-right: 0in">A
    description of what the data itself means, such as how to
    interpret scores or full signal values.  This section can also be
    used to describe how the display may be customized by using
    configuration controls.</P>
    <P><B>Methods</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.26in; margin-right: 0in">A
    description of how the data was generated, which may include how
    physical samples were treated as well as explanations of data
    handling algorithms.</P>
    <P><B>Credits</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.26in; margin-right: 0in">Names
    and institutions of those who performed the experiments and/or
    prepared the data as well as any funding sources.  This section
    should include a contact email address for questions concerning
    the data.</P>
    <P><B>References</B></P>
    <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.26in; margin-right: 0in">References
    to any published work referring to or dependent upon this data as
    well as any sources upon which the work is based or can be
    understood.</P>

<div class="format"><code>bigDataUrl &lt;url/relativePath&gt;</code></div>
    <P><I>Remote data file
    specific.</I></P>
    <P>This setting tells
    the Genome Browser where to look for the bigBed remote data file.
    It must be either and an internet accessible URL to a file or a
    relative path to one on your dataHub.  The file must be in one of
    the supported remote data file formats: bam, bigBed, bigWig and
    vcfTabIx.  Note that bam and vcfTabIx types require a separate
    index file that must be named the same as the data file plus a
    standard suffix (".bai" and ".tbi" respectively).
    </P>

<DIV class="boxedCfg"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>boxedCfg &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Configuration controls can be placed inside a
    box on the configuration page.  This setting is decorative only,
    but can make a busy page look more cohesive.  Default no.  Not all
    track types support this feature yet.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   boxedCfg on</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="canPack"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>canPack &lt;off/on&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Almost tracks should be displayable in the four
    standard visibilities.  However on some track types such as
    wiggles, <code>squish</code> and <code>pack</code> offer no real advantage
    over <code>dense</code> and <code>full</code>. By default, these tracks will
    not offer the less valuable visibilities. Nevertheless, you can make your track offer
    these visibilility choices by turning canPack on.  Note: subtracks
    of composites will always offer all four choices.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   canPack on</pre>
    <P><I>TODO: loose this entirely?  I vote yes, to
    decrease complexity.</I></P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="color"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>color &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow setting the color of the
    data as displayed in the image with this setting.  Not all display
    modes will show this color.  The setting accepts red, green and
    blue values delimited by commas, and each in the range of 0-255.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   color 255,0,0</pre>
    <P>Sets color to red.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="altColor"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>altColor &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow setting a color range
    which will vary from color to altColor.  An example might be a bed
    type track with scores for each item and the highest scores will
    receive color, while the lowest receives altColor and the rest of
    the scores appear along the gradient.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   altColor 0,0,255</pre>
    <P>Sets alternate color to blue.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="chromosomes"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>chromosomes &lt;chr1,chr2,...&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Some datasets do not contain data for all
    chromosomes of a genome.  When this is true, use this setting as a
    comma separated list of the chromosomes that are covered.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   chromosomes chr1,chr7,chr18,chr19,chr22,chrX,chrM</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="configureByPopup"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>configureByPopup &lt;on/off&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Most tracks that can have their display
    configured by a user, can be configured from directly within the
    Browser image by choosing a right-click option.  This will pop-up
    a configuration dialog.  While this functionality works on the
    majority of track types, some configuration dialogs are too
    complex or with too much embedded javascript control to reliably
    configure them with a pop-up.  To turn off right-click configure
    by pop-up, use this setting.  The user will still be able to
    configure the track on the dedicated configuration page.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   configureByPopup off</pre>
</DIV>

<DIV class="dataVersion"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>dataVersion &lt;str&gt;</code></div>
    <P><I>TODO: Jim says
    DEPRECATE (but it's a very simple, useful setting).</I></P>
    <P>Many tracks may have
    multiple revisions over time.  In some cases, the older versions
    are worth keeping around, but even if they are not, it can be
    useful to declare exactly which version the current track is.  Use
    this setting to put a version statement only the track
    configuration page and item details page of a track.  The string
    will support limited HTML.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   dataVersion May 2011 &lt;em&gt;beta&lt;/em&gt;</pre>

    practical or expedient. Therefore, the dataset may have its genome
    coordinates "lifted over" to the more recent assembly.

    feature relies upon items of the same name and the name being
    unique in the bed track of both genomes.  The format of this
    setting is a genome/assembly database, table and column paired
    with a label for the link.  If the column is omitted, it is
    assumed to be <code>name</code> and if the table is omitted, it
    is assumed to be the same as the current table.  Links to multiple
    genomes can be established with this setting as each pair is
    joined by '<code>=</code>' and delimited by space.  Be sure to use

    </div>
    <P><I>Not Yet supported by bigBeds</I></P>
    <P>A number of
    numerical filters are available for bed tracks.  These are
    conveniently named by the field they are filtering on.  The most
    common numerical filter is based upon the standard bed field
    <code>score</code>, and is thus controlled by the <code>scoreFilter</code>
    setting.  Other examples are pValueFilter, qValueFilter and
    signalFilter, which are filters on non-standard bed fields defined
    in the broadPeak and narrowPeak formats.  These numerical filter
    settings should include the default value.  If the numeric field
    is floating point, the default should contain at least one decimal
    place.
    </P>
    <P>By default the range
    of values for a numeric filter are from 0 to 1000.  However, you
    can explicitly set the upper and lower limit of the filter by
    setting <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterLimits</code>.
    </P>
    <P>The numeric filters
    will exclude items that fall below the setting. That is, a
    scoreFilter of 800 will  exclude all items with a score below 800.
        You can also filter for values within a range, by including the
    <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterByRange</code> setting.  A <code>scoreFilter</code> range of
    800-900 will include only items with scores at or above 800 and
    below 900.</P>
    <P>Note: multiple
    filters of different fields are allowed.</P>
    <P><B>Examples:</B></P>
    <pre>   scoreFilter 100</pre>
    <P>The standard bed
    field of <code>score</code>, which is an integer will be used to filter items
    in the track.  By default, items with scores below 100 will be
    excluded.  Also by default the limits of the scoreFilter are
    0-1000.</P>
    <pre>

    pValueFilterLimits 0.0:15.0
    pValueFilterByRange o
    </pre>
    <P>The non-standard bed field of "<code>pValue</code>", which
    is floating-point, will be filtered by range.  The expected data
    range is 0-15 and by default only items with pValues within 3-15
    will be displayed.</P>

    <P><I>Not Yet supported by bigBeds</I></P>
    <P>Another method of
    filtering items relies upon discrete values.  One or more fields
    such as <code>name</code> or <code>score</code> may contain a limited number
    of discrete values which can be filtered on. These discrete values will be
    seen by the user in a drop down list from which to choose one or
    more options.  While the maximum number of options in the list is
    not set in stone, using filterBy for too many options can be
    difficult for the user.

    <P><I>Setting Complexities:</I></P>
    <UL>
    <LI> Filters for

    character.</LI>
    <LI> The field and
    option portions of the definition are delimited by '<code>=</code>'.</LI>
    <LI> The field portion
    can have a title which is delimited from the field name by '<code>:</code>'.</LI>
    <LI> A single field
    filter will have multiple options delimited by commas.</LI>
    <LI> If the options are
    a 1-based index (1,2,3...) then the option list can be preceded
    with a '<code>+</code>' and the options themselves are only labels.</LI>
    <LI> Otherwise, each
    option will be a value and optional label delimited by '<code>|</code>'.   Note
    that if one option has a label then all options of that filter
    must have a label.</LI>

        <I style="color:#880000;">Secret tricks:</I>
        <OL>
        <LI>The titles and
        labels need to avoid use of the delimiter chars (<code> ,=:|</code>).  But
        these characters can be included via HTML codes.  And remember
        that spaces can be included via the '<code>_</code>' character.</LI>
        <LI>The option labels
        can be in color or have other CSS style.  Append the style without
        blanks wrapped in curly brackets (e.g.
        <code>Pull_Over{color:#AA0000;text-decoration:blink;}</code>).
        Note that if one option has CSS style, then all options of that
        filter must include a style definition.</LI>
        <LI>The way that the
        filterBy option is acted upon in code is by an SQL <code>where</code> clause.
            For instance, filtering on the <code>name</code> field for "Fred" and
        "Ethyl" would result in an SQL where clause of
        "<code>where name in ('Fred','Ethyl')</code>".  In "<code>type genePred</code>"
        tracks, this knowledge is used to define filters on fields in a separate table!
        This is done by defining the field as <code>{otherTableName}.{fieldName}</code>.</LI>
        </OL>
    </div>
    <P>The best way to
    understand this setting is with an example.  This is a working
    example in the hg19 "Open Chrom Synth" track.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    filterBy color:Validation_Level=\
             0|Validated_(OC_1){color:#000000},\
             255|Open_Chromatin_(OC_2-3){color:#0000FF},\

    <P>This setting sets up
    2 filters, one on the field "<code>color</code>" and a second for the
    "<code>ocCode</code>" field.  The color filter is given the title "Validation
    Level".  The second option has a value of "255" and a label
    of "Open Chromatin (OC 2-3)".  Notice it will appear
    as blue in the list due to the {color:#0000FF} style definition.
    Also notice that all options for this color field have a style
    defined, even though the first option is black and would be so by
    default.</P>
    <P>Notice the only
    white-space in the setting value comes before the second filter
    definition.  The second filter, "<code>ocCode</code>", is titled by the
    inscrutable "OC Code".  It is a numeric index filter
    (as declared by the '<code>+</code>').  The value of the second option is 2 and
    only the label gets defined as "Two: Dnase (all)".  Notice
    that the colon in the label is an HTML code.

    <P><I>These generic filter controls should work by

<DIV class="itemRgb"><span class="types bed bigBed bedDetail bedGraph bedLogR"></span>
<div class="format"><code>itemRgb on</code></div>
    <P>In bed formats with
    at least 9 standard bed fields, this setting can be used to turn
    on item coloring by the value in the ninth "<code>itemRgb</code>" field. The
    value of the  item field should be an R,G,B triplet.  When loaded
    into a table, this field appears as an integer with the RGB values
    in specific bits of the integer.</P>

<DIV class="maxItems"><span class="types bed bigBed broadPeak psl"></span>
<div class="format"><code>maxItems &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Maximum number of
    items to be displayed individually in full mode.  If there are
    more items than this they will be drawn on top of each other on

<DIV class="maxWindowToDraw"><span class="types bed genepred bam rmsk narrowPeak broadPeak bigWig bedlogR"></span>
<div class="format"><code>maxWindowToDraw &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <P>When too many
    individual bed items are shown in the Browser image, the
    information is better summarized as when seen in dense mode.  Too
    many bed items is especially likely when a large window on a
    chromosome is viewed. Depending upon the current visibility of the
    bed track and on what other tracks are shown concurrently, the
    data may be automatically reduced to pack or dense mode.  However,
    you can set maxWindowToDraw and force the summarization of data
    when you know it is unreasonable.  The setting is the number of
    bases to be seen in a window after which the track will be forced
    to dense mode.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   maxWindowToDraw 200000</pre>

<DIV class="maxWindowToQuery"><span class="types bed bigWig bedlogR"></span>
<div class="format"><code>maxWindowToQuery &lt;integer&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Like with maxWindowToDraw, this setting is used
    to limit the amount of data seen, when too much data p[resents
    difficulties.  This setting is used to block attempting to get
    data when the size of the chromosome viewing window to too large.
    This can be useful if your track displays short items when zoomed

    this setting can be used to set the lightest level to be used.
    Without it, low scores might be too light to see.  Set the value
    in the range of 1-9, lightest to darkest.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   minGrayLevel   4</pre>

    field exists.  This score which is expected to vary from 0-1000,
    can be used to shade bed items when they are drawn in the Browser
    image.  To turn this feature on set <code>spectrum on</code>.
    Lower scores will be shaded in light gray by default, while higher
    scores grade to black.  This can be modified in a number of ways:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI> <A onclick="jumpTo(this)" HREF="#">color</A>

    <P>In bed tracks that

    thick like exons in gene models are drawn thicker than introns.
    When data is viewed at different scales, the items and the thick
    portions of the items should scale proportionally.  However, it
    may be more important to see the existence of the thick regions

    <P>The bedGraph type
    track has the same file format as a bed file, but is loaded into
    the MySQL database in a form that can be graphed.  By default the
    value to be graphed is the 5th standard bed field:
    <code>score</code>.  However, you can declare which field to use.
        Typically only the first 3 standard bed fields are included
    (<code>chrom</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>) and the 4th field
    contains the signal value.  The "<code>type bedGraph</code>" track introduced
    a couple of important improvements over the "<code>type wig</code>" tracks.  In "wig"
    tracks, the value of the signal is truncated into a single byte,
    which is effective for graphing but fails at data storage.  Also
    the "wig" type was designed for fixed size windowing, though
    variations were added.  The "bedGraph" type allows for variable
    windowing and even defining values down to the base level.  To be
    clear, "<code>type bigWig</code>" tracks are as versatile as "bedGraphs".  It is
    only the "wig" format that suffers from these limitations.</P>
    <P>Note that the limits
    of the "bedGraph" signal are not declared in the type, but are
    declared with 2 separate settings.

<DIV class="graphTypeDefault"><span class="types wig bigWig bedGraph bamWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>graphTypeDefault points</code></div>
    <P>The signal can be

    <P>The amount of
    vertical viewing space for your signal track should be declared,
    though it is configurable by the user.  Typically it is set to no
    more than 100 pixels and no less than 8, with a default of 16 or
    32 pixels.</P>

<DIV class="smoothingWindow"><span class="types wig bigWig bedGraph bamWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>smoothingWindow &lt;off/1-16&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Often signal
    information is chunky as a single value is given for a number of
    bases.  The graph can smooth the chunky data which may present an
    more reflective of the actual biology it is meant to illustrate.
    The numerical value of this setting can determine how much
    surrounding data to use for smoothing.  The larger the number, the
    less abrupt the curves will be.  By default this is off and it is
    user configurable.</P>

    <P>Data in your graph
    track may be of most interest in a narrow range.  Typically very
    high outlier values can skew a graph and very low values may
    represent uninteresting data.  Use viewLimits to set the default
    viewing range.  Also use viewLimitsMax as suggested outer bounds.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    viewLimits 5:20
    viewLimitsMax0:100
    </pre>
    <P>Any data points that are 20 or above will be
    shown as the peak of the graph.  Any data points that are below 5
    will not even be seen.  Even though the full data range is goes to
    100, these settings suggest that scores of 20 or more are all
    considered highly relevant.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="wigColorBy"><span class="types wig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>wigColorBy &lt;bedTable&gt;</code></div>
    <P>wig type only</P>
    <P>Regions of your
    graphed signal may be highlighted by color.  Use a <code>bed</code> type
    table and "<code>color</code>" settings to shade regions of your <code>wig</code>
    track.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    wigColorBy myBed
    color 175,150,128
    altColor 255,128,0
    </pre>
    <P>The bed type table "myBed" is used to highlight
    regions of graphed signal based upon the scores in that table.
    The table may itself be visible track, or could exist only for the
    purpose of highlighting the signal track.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="windowingFunction"><span class="types wig bigWig bedGraph bamWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>windowingFunction  &lt;mean/mean+whiskers/maximum/minimum&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Depending upon how
    much of the genome is displayed in the Browser image, the actual
    signal may necessarily be summarized.  What the Browser does when
    it must collapse the signal from 100 or 100 thousand bases down to
    a single pixel can be controlled with this setting.  By default
    the single pixel will represent the "<code>mean</code>" of the data, though the
    "<code>maximum</code>" or "<code>minimum</code>" can be displayed.  A more informative
    option is often "<code>mean+whiskers</code>".  This setting will display the
    mean, max and one standard deviation above mean in shades.  That
    is, the mean will be displayed as darkest, with one stdDev above
    slightly lighter and then all the way to the max lighter still.
    This subtle shading can be quickly informative as to whether the
    condensed data is hiding important information that can only truly
    be evaluated by zooming in.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   windowingFunction mean+whiskers</pre>
    <P>When zoomed out, this track will show the mean
    signal but include shading representing higher scores.  The user
    may change this setting.</P>
</DIV>

<div class="format">
    <code>yLineMark &lt;#&gt;</code><BR>
    <code>yLineOnOff &lt;off/on&gt;</code><BR>
    <code>gridDefault   on</code></div>
    <P>It can be useful to
    draw a line across the track's signal graph at some fixed y
    coordinate.  Do this by setting yLineOnOff and declaring the
    coordinate with <code>yLineMark</code>.  These two settings are
    configurable by the user and you are only declaring defaults if
    different from off and 0.0.</P>
    <P>Often confused with
    these configurable settings is the gridDefault which simply puts a
    a line at y=0 across your entire track.  This setting might be
    useful if lack of data is equivalent to a 0 signal.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    yLineOnOff on
    yLineMark 2.5
    gridDefault on
    </pre>
    <P>The signal is graphed with a default solid line
    at zero, suggesting that any gaps in data should be interpreted as
    zero signal.  There will also be a line at signal height of 2.5,
    which may be used to emphasize which peaks in the signal reach
    this critical height.</P>

<DIV class="chain_intro">
<H3>chain and netAlign: paired species alignments</H3>
    <P>While "<code>chain</code>" and
    "<code>netAlign</code>" formats are different, they often are paired to show two
    different views of the same data.
    </P>
    <P>Chain tracks show
    alignments of a "query" species to a "target" genome assembly.  For
    example, a chimp panTro2 can be aligned to the human hg19 genome.
    The chain format allows for gaps in both sequences simultaneously.
    When chains are viewed in the Browser, they show solid boxes for
    alignments, separated by either single or double lines.  The single
    lines appear when an insertion occurs in the target or a deletion
    occurs in the querying species.  Double lines represent gaps in both
    species which could result from a number of causes (e.g. an inversion
    in one species).  For more information on the "chain" format, please
    refer to: <A HREF="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html">
    http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html</A></P>
    <P>A netAlign track
    represents the best chain for each region in target genome.  The net
    track will show the largest, highest scoring chains that span a
    region.  When these chains have gaps, they may be "filled in"
    with additional chains, shown at a lower level, and gaps in thes
    chains may in turn be filled at an even lower level.  These levels
    help to visualizing genome rearrangements such as inversions and
    retroposed elements.    For more information on the "netAlign"

<DIV class="compositeTrack_intro">
<H3>Composite Tracks</H3>
    <P>Composite tracks are
    another level of hierarchy and are meant to group very similar tracks
    (called "subtracks") together such that they can all
    share the same configuration settings.  In its simplest form a
    composite holds tracks all of the same type (such as bigWig).
    Initially, the entire set of tracks will be configured the same way.
    Often not all subtracks will be visible by default, however, but all
    that are visible will have the same mode (e.g. <code>dense</code>)
    and the same optional settings (e.g. <code>viewLimits</code>).
    While default settings cover the entire composite of related tracks,
    in most cases individual subtracks can be configured by the user
    independent of the composite settings.  However, once individual
    subtrack settings are made, they can be overridden by new composite
    level choices.  It may be helpful to read the "<I>Note about
    inheritance</I>" found below.</P>
    <P><I>Currently not all
    track types can be organized into a composite.  The following, may
    be: item based tracks (bed, bigBeg, broadPeaks, etc.), signal based
    tracks (wig, bigWig, etc.), other remote file based tracks (bams,
    vcf, etc.), Chains/Nets, genePred, psl, and wigMaf type tracks.</I></P>

    <P>To declare a composite, simply add this setting

    types and one antibody to display in the Browser.  A composite can
    define up to 9 subgroup types.  However, before you get carried away,
    the more subgroups a composite has the more complicated the user
    interface will be.  Typically defining two subGroups in an X by Y
    matrix is enough organization and is an easy UI to navigate.  However
    it is possible to define more subgroups in additional "abc"
    dimensions and allow the user to select from these with drop down
    multi-select dialogs.</P>

    <P>To declare up to 9
    subGroups, create a setting for each one.  The white-space
    delimited arguments are the subGroup's "tag"
    followed by title, and then any number of membership pairs joined
    by an '<code>=</code>' equal sign.  Each membership pair is a tag
    and a title.  A tag is a term that can be used in code to select
    and sort subtracks based upon their membership.  Therefore, tags
    should follow simple rules.  A tag should begin with a letter,
    contain nothing but letters and digits and be formed so that the
    desired sort order of the members will result.
    </P>
    <P>Note that titles may
    have spaces but the entire subGroup setting is delimited by
    white-space.  Therefore, use the '<code>_</code>' character in
    place of spaces in titles.  Further, in titles, a limited amount
    of HTML is allowed, such as inserting greek letters with an HTML
    code. However, you should experiment to get the best results and
    should not assume your HTML code will work.

    selecting subtracks based upon groups, additional settings are
    needed at the composite level.  For a one or 2 dimension array of
    checkboxes, declare the dimensions X and Y.  Additional (called

    <P>For the "abc"
    dimensions, rows of checkboxes will be shown by default.  But this
    UI, especially combined with a one or 2 dimension matrix, is
    confusing.  It is preferred to organize "abc"
    dimensions as drop-down multi-selects often referred to as
    "filter" boxes due to their similarity to the
    <code>filterBy</code> setting for filtering items discussed
    above.  Declare the subtrack filter boxes with the filterComposite
    setting.  Filter composites may work with or without the X/Y
    matrix but always is restricted to "abc" dimensions.</P>
    <P>By default, a filter box for selecting
    subtracks is a multi-select, meaning more than one choice is
    allowed.  It is possible to restrict this to a single choice, by
    adding the "<code>=one</code>" option to the filter box definition.
        This might make sense when there are only 2 choices.  The choice
    of "all" is always available, while choosing nothing is an invalid

    <P>One more wrinkle in this selection process is
    determining what subgroup options are selected by default.  In the
    case of the X/Y matrix this can be determined by what subtracks
    are currently checked.  But for reasons of indeterminate UI
    abstraction, the "abc" dimensions must have their

    terms, as they are displayed in the track configuration page can
    be links to the controlled vocabulary definitions.  These links
    can be quite useful, as the term definition may include protocol
    documents and validation evidence.  In order to establish the

    <P>When declaring subgroups, it is often useful to
    sort the subtrack list by those subgroups.  By including a
    sortOrder setting, long sets of subtracks are more easily
    organized and navigated by the user.  If there are only a few
    subtracks in the composite, sorting may be of little value.

    <P>Some composite track sets have their own
    directories of downloadable files and a special CGI for accessing
    those files.  In order to see the CGI interface for the download
    directory, the composite needs an object for each file defined in
    the metaDb.  The trackDb stanza for the composite also needs to
    have the fileSortOrder setting defined.  The setting is defined as
    a set of variable=value pairs, which defines the default sort
    order on metaDb variables.  The "var" portion of the each pair is
    a term defined in the metaDb for all of the file objects in the
    directory.  The "var" may also be "<code>fileType</code>" or "<code>fileSize</code>",
    which are not defined in the metaDb. The "val" is the title that the
    user will see as the column header for the sortable table of
    files.  This value can contain and '<code>_</code>' for spaces and limited HTML
        codes and special characters.  As always, you are encouraged to
    experiment.  Also, please use the '<code>\</code>' continuation character to
    make this long setting readable.

    </pre>
    <P>The composite with
    one subtrack and three subgroups is shown.  Notice that the
    dimensions setting declares X and Y dimensions so those will be in
    a 2D matrix on the composite's configuration page.  Also
    notice that a third dimension is declared as the "A"
    dimension and the user will be able to select subtracks for this
    dimension by a drop down multi-select filter box.  Notice that the
    title of the cellLine subgroup contains a blank space filled in
    with '<code>_</code>'.  The second cell line includes an HTML code
    in the title for '<code>+</code>', making the user see "CD14+"
    as the cell line. All three subgroups participate in the default
    sort order, but they each have non-standard sort orders.  For
    cells, GM12878 sorts first by starting its tag with "A".
        The antibodies have numbers in their titles, but the tags expand
    the number with "0" to pad the spacing.  This ensures
    H3K4me3 sorts before H3K36me3.  Finally the treatment "None"
    sorts after "TNF-alpha" by beginning the tag with a
    "Z".  That said, the default sort order on the
    treatment group is reverse, so that "None" will be
    seen first.  Also note that for this "A" dimension,
    the "None" treatment will be selected by default.  By
    declaring the proper settings, using subGroups to organize a
    composite can be quite powerful.</P>
    <P>Another thing this example illustrates is that
    subgroups, dimensions and, for ENCODE, controlled vocabulary and
    metadata all must be linked together for the composite to fully
    work.  Further, the actual terms, programmatic "tags"
    and user visible titles all have different constraints and roles
    to play in establishing this cohesion.  Subgroup tags are used to
    organize subtracks, while lettered dimensions organize the
    configuration page to more easily select subgroups of subtracks.
    For ENCODE tracks, the subgroups may be represented as metadata
    "terms" (distinct from tags) which are often carefully
    defined in controlled vocabulary.  In the example above, the tag
    "ab" is used to organize subtracks into subgroups but
    is also tied to dimension X.  This ensures that antibodies will
    appear as the horizontal dimension in the 2D matrix on the
    configuration page and selecting an antibody will select the
    associated subtracks.  Of course the user does not see the
    antibody as "ab" but "Antibody".  Going
    further, the term as defined in controlled vocabulary is
    "antibody", so that for all the tables and files
    associated with this composite track, their metaDb objects should
    contain an "antibody" var and a given antibody (e.g.
    H3K4me3) will be found in the controlled vocabulary with a
    validation document.  All the relationships can be confusing, but
    the trackDb settings, if done correctly, can tie all these
    elements together in a nice cohesive package.</P>

<!-- - - - - - - - VIEW settings - - - - - - - -->
<DIV class="view_intro">
<H3>Views</H3>
    <P>Finally, a single
    composite can be divided into multiple "views".  Recall
    that a composite should be made up of subtracks of the same <code>type</code>.
    But different types of subtracks can be combined into the same
    composite track if they are in separate  "views".  While
    views are like subgroups in many ways, they can carry their own
    settings.  This is necessary because one view may be for bigBeds and
    another for bigWigs.  Each of these types have their own distinct
    configuration settings.</P>
    <P>The "view" (AKA
    "multi-view") organization is typically done when the
    same basic data is stored in multiple formats and granularities.  For
    example views may include, raw sequence tags (type bam), then signals
    representing pile ups of aligned tags (type bigWig), then peaks (type
    bigBed) that are called where the evidence of experimental result is
    deemed significant.  These three "views" of the same
    experimental data can be more informatively seen as a cohesive set
    within a multi-view composite track.</P>
    <P>Views are declared both
    as a subgroup and as a separate track stanza.  A composite with
    multiple views has only views as children and each view will have one
    or more subtracks as children.  The three levels must be defined
    together with indenting to make the hierarchy obvious.</P>
    <P><I><U>A note about
    inheritance.</U></I> Subtracks
    will inherit settings from their parents (both  from composites and
    from views).  This is so if the setting is inheritable, and most
    settings are inheritable.  Obvious exceptions are settings that are
    only relevant to the higher level.  Inheritance follows the "closest
    to home" paradigm, meaning that a setting at the subtrack level
    takes precedence, but if not found, then the view level setting is
    used, unless that is not found, then the composite level setting is
    used.  This inheritance is both for trackDb default settings and for
    the choices that a user makes that get saved to the cart.  In the
    case of user choices, there is a timing dimension as well.  When the
    user makes a parent level setting, it will override all settings of
    the same type, below.  But if the user subsequently makes a subtrack
    setting, it will override the inherited setting for that one
    subtrack.</P>
    <P>The only real
    monkey-wrench in inheritance is "<code>visiblity</code>".  Unlike
    other settings, visibility is cumulatively restrictive from the
    supertrack level.  That is, if the parent is "<code>dense</code>" and a child is
    "<code>pack</code>", the child will be seen as "<code>dense</code>".  Change the parent to
    "<code>full</code>" and the child will now be seen as "<code>pack</code>".  At the trackDb
    level, default visibility is always cumulatively restrictive.
    However, when a user explicitly changes a subtrack visibility to be
    greater than what was inherited from parents, that subtracks
    visibility will override the inheritance.  While the subtleties of
    inheritance can be hard to to explain, it is often intuitive in
    practice.</P>

    <P>A view is always declared both as a subgroup

    previous declarations, but the view subgroup must have the tag

    too cluttered.  The user must first open the box before its
    contents is seen.  If there is only one view with configuration
    settings, or if the view is the most important one, the box can be
    open by default.  Use this setting in the view stanza of settings

<DIV class="configurable"><span class="types view composite"></span>

    <P>Tracks are configurable by default if their

    configurable if their children's track type supports this.
    Finally individual subtracks are configurable by default,
    presuming their track type supports it.  Sometimes it is desirable
    to turn off configuration.  You can also turn configuration back
    on when it has been turned off at a higher level.  This might be
    useful if you have a multi-view composite where the composite
    level would normally be configurable, but you want only one of the
    views and not all of the children of that view to be configurable.
        While this setting might be rarely needed, it can help restrict

    <P>The composite has two views, one of which is
    shown, along with a single subtrack belonging to that view.
    Notice that the view does not participate in the dimensions
    setting, as it is an implicit dimension controlled by a row of
    visibility dialogs at the top of the composite configuration page.
        Notice that the view does participate in the sortOrder setting
    like other subgroups.   In this example, the peaks view contains
    bigBed subtracks and they all share the scoreFilter defaults
    defined at the view level.  Almost any setting that is common to
    the whole tree can be defined at the composite level, any setting
    that is common to the view can be set at the view level, and any
    setting that is specific to one subtrack should be set at that
    level.  Inheritance works by a "closest to home" logic
    in almost all cases, meaning the nearest setting overrides higher
    settings.  One exception to this is visibility, where the setting
    at a higher level limits the range at the lower level.  From this,
    we can see that the subtracks shown, inherits its track type from
    the view, but has its default visibility limited by the composite.
        That is, it inherits packed visibility from the view but the
    composite will show all visible subtracks as dense.</P>

<DIV class="container_intro">
<H3>Aggregate or Overlay Tracks: multiWig</H3>
    <P>Some track data is so
    related that it makes sense to view it as a single track.  The
    premiere (and currently only) example of this is the signal overlay
    track (AKA "<code>multiWig</code>").  Signal overlay tracks display the signal
    data from several subtracks as colored transparencies, making it
    possible to see the data of several tracks together in a condensed
    view.  The purpose of the overlay track goes beyond condensing the
    image, however.  Occasionally this is the most obvious way to see
    hidden relationships in the underlying data.  The overlay track
    should not be overused, however.  Attempts to overlay too many
    subtracks can hide important information as regions with many layered
    signals become too dark to interpret.  More than 8 subtracks in a
    single overlay may prove less than ideal.  Just as with composites,
    it is important for like tracks to have the same dimensions of data.
    That is, a signal height of 100 should be interpretable in the same
    way for the whole set of tracks.  While this is true for a composite
    or view, it is especially important for overlay tracks.  You cannot
    reasonably overlay a signal from 0-1 with another signal fro 0-1000.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="container"><span class="types container multiWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>container multiWig</code></div>
    <P>Signal overlay tracks are declared much like
    simple composites.  However, instead of a "composite"
    setting, they declare themselves as a "container" of
    "<code>type multiWig</code>".  Like simple composites, all subtrack
    types should be identical and the container itself should be
    declared as of that type (e.g. "<code>bigWig</code>").  Also like a composite,
    the container parent should have common settings for all children.
        Unlike composites, containers can have neither subgroups nor
    views.  Additionally, containers will have all their subtracks
    configured as one.  That is there will be no independent
    configuration of the container's subtracks.  Even when the user
    sets the overlay method to none, and the subtracks are viewed as
    separate signals, they are still configured as a set.</P>

<DIV class="parent_container"><span class="types container multiWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>parent &lt;containerTrack&gt;</code></div>

    method.  The preferred of the three current options is
    <code>transparentOverlay</code>.  You shouldn't use <code>solidOverlay</code> if there
    are more than a couple of tracks, and "<code>none</code>" should never be the

    <P>This container is for a transparent overlay of
    signal tracks with 2 subtracks shown.  Notice that the tracks are
    of type "<code>bigWig</code>", though the first subtrack is a <code>wig</code>.
    Such mixtures are allowed.  Also notice that the wig has a slightly
    larger range than the others.  The signal dimensions are close
    enough in this case, and the default viewLimit applied to all
    subtracks suggests that any signal above 10 is interpreted as
    strong.  Notice that the subtracks each must define its color, and
    in this example, that color will be seen in the track
    configuration page as well as in the image.  Also notice that the
    first subtrack declares a table as distinct from its track name.
    Usually the table (or remote file root) name is the same as the
    track name.  The track name is a unique key.  But it is frequently
    the case that a table or remote data file may be displayed as an
    individual track or subtrack, AND as part of an signal overlay
    track.  Setting the table name here suggests that a track named
    "myFirstWig" also exists and is displaying the same data used in
    this overlay track.</P>
