<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track provides an integrated display of DNase hypersensitivity in multiple
cell types using overlapping colored graphs of signal density with graph colors
assigned to cell types based on similarity of signal. The track is based on
results of experiments performed by the John Stamatoyannapoulos lab at the
University of Washington from September 2007 to January 2011 as part of the
<a href="../ENCODE" target="_blank">ENCODE project first production phase</a>.</p>
<p>
The signal graphs displayed here are also included in the comprehensive
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase">DNaseI HS</a> track,
which also provides peak and region calls and uses the same coloring based on
similiarity of cell types (please note there is different coloring on the ENCODE hg38
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegTxn">Transcription</a> track,
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k4me1">Layered H3K4Me1</a> track,
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k4me3">Layered H3K4Me3</a> track, and
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k27ac">Layered H3K27Ac</a> track,
which match the coloring used in their previous versions lifted from the hg19 assembly). 
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Raw sequence data files were processed by the UCSC ENCODE DNase analysis pipeline
described in the 
<A target="_blank" href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase">DNaseI HS</a>
track description.
Signal graphs were normalized so the average value genome-wide is 1.
Colors for the signal graphs were assigned by the UCSC BigWigCluster tool.

<p>
The cell types were clustered into a binary tree, a rainbow was cast to the leaf nodes providing coloring based on similarity.
