<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Retrotransposons constitute over 40% of the human genome and
consist of several millions of family members. They play important
roles in shaping the structure and evolution of the genome and in
participating in gene functioning and regulation. Because L1, Alu, and SVA
retrotransposons are currently active in the human genome, their recent
and ongoing retrotranspositional insertions generate a unique and important
class of genetic polymorphisms (for the presence or absence of an insertion)
among and within human populations. As such, they are useful genetic markers
in population genetics studies due to their identical-by-descent and
essentially homoplasy-free nature. Additionally, some polymorphic
insertions are known to be responsible for a variety of human genetic
diseases. dbRIP, a database of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms
(RIPs), contains all currently known Alu, L1, and SVA polymorphic
insertion loci in the human genome.
