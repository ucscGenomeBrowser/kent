        We are excited to announce the release of the new stacked
	overlay method for multi-wiggle tracks. This new stacked overlay
	method displays each graph stacked on top of each other.

	>H3K27Ac Mark</A> on the human hg19 assembly to view this new stacked
	overlay method on a multi-wiggle track. On the track settings page,
	from the "Overlay method" drop-down menu select "stacked". Make sure
	that the display mode is not set to hide, and click submit.

        <font face="courier" size="3"><b> 29 Apr 2014 - 
        100-species Conservation track re-release</b></font>
        <p>
        We released the initial version of the 100-species Conservation track
        for the hg19 human assembly in November 2013. Over the past few months,
        we found a couple of inconsistencies and decided, for the integrity of
        the data, that we should rerun the computation pipeline and re-release
        the data. The fixes required minimal changes, and resulted in a more
        precise data set. We published the new version of the hg19 100-species
        Conservation track on 15 April 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
        Here are more details about the two fixes that we made:
        </p>
        <p>
        1. We tracked down the cause of some unusual gaps in the alignments to a 
        bug in the multiz program used in our alignment pipeline. The Penn State 
        Bioinformatics Group provided us with a fixed version of multiz that we 
        used to rerun the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
        2. We inadvertently used the pre-release assembly for one of the species 
        in the 100-way alignment: the panda. We replaced this assembly with the 
        correct version and verified that the data sets for all other species 
        were correct before rerunning the pipeline.
