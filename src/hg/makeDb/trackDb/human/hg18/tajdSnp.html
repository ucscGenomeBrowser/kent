<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the SNPs that were used in the calculation of Tajima's D 
(Tajima, 1989), a measure of nucleotide
diversity, estimated from the Perlegen data set (Hinds <em>et al.</em>, 2005).
Tajima's D is a statistic used to compare an observed nucleotide
diversity against the expected diversity under the assumption that all
polymorphisms are selectively neutral and constant population size.
The original SNP coordinates were from the Human May 2004 assembly;
they were transformed to this assembly using UCSC's liftOver program.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

use of this track.</P>
