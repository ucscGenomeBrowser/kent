This directory contains programs for manipulating files in tagStorm format,  a
relatively simple text based format that is often a good alternative to a big
tab-separated-file or spreadsheet, and that is used often at UCSC.

The basic idea of the format is one tag per line with the first word of the
line containing the tag name, and the rest of the line containing the tag 
value.  Stanzas are separated by blank lines.  If a stanza is indented relative
to the previous stanza, it is considered a child of that stanza.  Children
inherit tags from their parents.   A tag corresponds to a column in a 
spreadsheet, and a stanza to a row.
