<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the sequences used for the selection of 
probes on the Affymetrix GNF1M chips. The annotation contains 31,000 
non-overlapping mouse genes and gene predictions.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The sequences were mapped to the genome with blat followed by pslReps 
using the parameters <TT>-minCover=0.3</TT>, <TT>-minAli=0.95</TT> and 
<TT>-nearTop=0.005</TT>.  </P>
