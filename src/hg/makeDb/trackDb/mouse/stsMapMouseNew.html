<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows locations of Sequence Tagged Sites (STS) 
along the mouse draft assembly.  These markers have been mapped using 
either genetic mapping (<A href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/mouse/index"
TARGET=_blank>WICGR Mouse Genetic Map</A>, <A href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/"
TARGET=_blank>MGD Genetic Map</A>) or radiation hybridization mapping
(<A href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/mouse_rh/index.html"
TARGET=_blank>Whitehead/MRC RH Map</A>) techniques.</p>  

Additional data on the individual maps can be found at the following links:
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists" TARGET=_blank>NCBI UniSTS</A>
<LI><A href="http://www.informatics.jax.org" TARGET=_blank> Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)</A>
</UL>

<P>By default all genetic map markers are shown as blue; only radiation 
hybrid markers and markers that are neither genetic nor radiation hybrid 
are shown as black; markers that map to more than one position are 
shown in lighter colors. Users  can choose a color to highlight a subset 
of markers of interest from the Filter options in STS Markers 
Track Setting page.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>Positions of STS markers are determined using both full sequences
and primer information.  Full sequences are aligned using <A
HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>,
while <A
HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/e-pcr/"
TARGET = _BLANK">ePCR</A> is used to find locations using primer information.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude
a set of map data within the track. This is helpful when many items
are shown in the track display, especially when only some are relevant
to the current task. To use the filter:
<UL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the map whose data you would like to
highlight or exclude in the display. By default, the &quot;All
Genetic&quot; option is selected.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If
&quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not display data from
the map selected in the pulldown list. If &quot;include&quot; is
selected, the browser will display only data from the selected map.
</UL></P>
<P>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the
<em>Submit</em> button.</P>
