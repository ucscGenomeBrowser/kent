# gappedPeak.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also
# generated gappedPeak.c and gappedPeak.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly
# automatic way.

#This format is used to provide called regions of signal enrichment based on pooled, normalized (interpreted) data where the regions may be spliced or incorporate gaps in the genomic sequence. It is a BED12+3 format.
