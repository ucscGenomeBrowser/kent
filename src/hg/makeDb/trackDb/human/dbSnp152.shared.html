<h2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</h2>
<p>
SNVs and pure deletions are displayed as boxes covering the affected base(s).
Pure insertions are drawn as single-pixel tickmarks between
the base before and the base after the insertion.
</p><p>
Insertions and/or deletions in repetitive regions may be represented by a half-height box
showing uncertainty in placement, followed by a full-height box showing the number of deleted
bases, or a full-height tickmark to indicate an insertion.
When an insertion or deletion falls in a repetitive region, the placement may be ambiguous.
For example, if the reference genome contains "TAAAG" but some
individuals have "TAAG" at the same location, then the variant is a deletion of a single
A relative to the reference genome.
However, which A was deleted?  There is no way to tell whether the first, second or third A
was removed.
Different variant mapping tools may place the deletion at different bases in the reference genome.
In order to reduce errors in merging variant calls made with different left vs. right biases,
dbSNP made a major change in its representation of deletion/insertion variants in build 152.
Now, instead of assigning a single-base genomic location at one of the A's,
dbSNP expands the coordinates to encompass the whole repetitive region,
so the variant is represented as a deletion of 3 A's combined with an insertion of 2 A's.
In the track display, there will be a half-height box covering the first two A's,
followed by a full-height box covering the third A, in order to show a net loss of one base
but an uncertain placement within the three A's.
</p>
<p>
Variants are colored according to functional effect on genes annotated by dbSNP.
Protein-altering variants and splice site variants are
red,
synonymous codon variants are
green,
and non-coding transcript or Untranslated Region (UTR) variants are
blue.
</p>
<p>
On the track controls page, several variant properties can be included or excluded from
the item labels:
rs# identifier assigned by dbSNP,
reference/alternate alleles,
major/minor alleles (when available) and
minor allele frequency (when available).
Allele frequencies are reported independently by nine projects, as described by dbSNP:

<h2>Data Sources and Methods</h2>
<p>
dbSNP has collected genetic variant reports from researchers worldwide for 
<a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2019/10/07/dbsnp-celebrates-20-years/"
   target=_blank>over 20 years</a>.
Since the advent of next-generation sequencing methods and the population sequencing efforts
that they enable, dbSNP has grown exponentially, requiring a new data schema, computational pipeline,
web infrastructure, and download files.
(Holmes <em>et al.</em>)
The same challenges of exponential growth affected UCSC's presentation of dbSNP variants,
so we have taken the opportunity to change our internal representation and import pipeline.
Most notably, flanking sequences are no longer provided by dbSNP,
since most submissions have been genomic variant calls in VCF format as opposed to
independent sequences.
</p>
<p>
We downloaded dbSNP's JSON files available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/archive/b152/JSON/"
target=_blank>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/archive/b152/JSON/</a>,
extracted a subset of the information about each variant, and collated
it into a bigBed file using the
<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/bigDbSnp.as"
target=_blank>bigDbSnp.as</a> schema with the information
necessary for filtering and displaying the variants,
as well as a separate file containing more detailed information to be
displayed on each variant's details page
(<a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/lib/dbSnpDetails.as"
target=_blank>dbSnpDetails.as</a> schema).
