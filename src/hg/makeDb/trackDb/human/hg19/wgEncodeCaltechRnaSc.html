<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project. 
Describe the project here.
A major goal of the ENCODE project is the complete characterization and understanding of the regulation and dynamics of the human transcriptome.
High-throughput sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-seq) has revolutionized work in this area by providing a genome-wide digital readout of transcription at base-pair resolution.
However, such measurements are typically performed on population consisting of a large number of cells thus the readout is the average of the transcriptome profiles of individual cells.
This masks potentially important cell-to-cell variation in transcript abundance, allele expression bias, dynamic response to external stimuli, etc. In order to adress these issues,
we have generated single-cell RNA-seq measurements for invidual cells from ENCODE cell lines.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>Experimental Procedures</H3>

<P> 
Cells were grown according to the approved <A href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" target="_BLANK">ENCODE cell culture protocols</A> 
Single GM12878 cells from suspension culture are aspirated with a micropipette.  The cell is deposited into a cell lysis/dT priming solution under visual observation to confirm the presence of a single cell.  The lysate is then frozen on dry ice and stored at -80C until processing.  After denaturation at 70C, first strand reverse transcription is performed with a template switching enzyme (Clontech).  18 cycles of PCR are used to amplify the cDNA into a double stranded library.  The amplified library is fragmented using transposome-mediated “tagmentation” (Epicentre), which simultaneously fragments and attaches Illumina sequencing primer sequences to the cDNA.  The fragmented cDNA (average size 300 bp) is amplified for an additional 9 cycles using primers which incorporate bridge PCR sequences and multiplex bar codes.  The final product is cleaned up using SPRI beads and submitted for bridge PCR cluster formation on an Illumina flow cell.
