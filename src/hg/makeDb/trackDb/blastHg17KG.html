<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains tBLASTn alignments of the peptides from the predicted and 
known genes identified in the hg17 Known Genes track.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
First, the predicted proteins from the human Known Genes track were aligned 
with the human genome using the blat program to discover exon boundaries.  
Next, the amino acid sequences that make up each exon were aligned with the 
$organism sequence using the tBLASTn program.
Finally, the putative $organism exons were chained together using an 
organism-specific maximum gap size but no gap penalty. The single best exon 
chains extending over more than 60% of the query protein were included. Exon 
chains that extended over 60% of the query and matched at least 60% of the 
protein's amino acids were also included.</P>
