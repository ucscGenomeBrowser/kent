<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE track is composed of all the gene models in the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/">GENCODE VM23 release</a>. By default, only the basic gene set 
is displayed, which is a subset of the comprehensive gene set. The basic set represents 
transcripts that GENCODE believes will be useful to the majority of users.
The track includes protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and pseudo-genes, though 
pseudo-genes are not displayed by default.</p>

<p>
The following table provides statistics for the VM23 release derived from the GTF file that 
contains annotations only on the main chromosomes. More information on how they were generated
can be found in the <a target="_blank" 
href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/stats.html">GENCODE site</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
By default, this track displays only the basic GENCODE set, splice variants, and non-coding 
genes. It includes options to display the comprehensive GENCODE set and pseudogenes. To customize 
these options, the respective boxes can be checked or unchecked at the top of this description 
page. Our FAQ includes examples of <a target="_blank" 
href="/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#justsingle">how to display a single transcript per gene</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#gencode">
switching between the basic and comprehensive gene sets</a>.</p>

<p>
This track also includes a variety of labels which identify the transcripts when visibility is 
set to &quot;full&quot; or &quot;pack&quot;. Gene symbols (e.g. NIPA1) are displayed by default, but additional 
options include GENCODE Transcript ID (ENSMUST00000052204.5), UCSC Known Gene ID (uc009hdu.2), 
and UniProt Display ID (Q8BHK1) . Additional information about gene and transcript 
names can be found in our <a target="_blank" href="/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#genename">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>
This track, in general, follows the display conventions for <a target="_blank"
href="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction tracks</a>. The exons
for putative non-coding genes and untranslated regions are represented by relatively thin blocks,
while those for coding open reading frames are thicker. The following color key is used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Black</span> -- feature has a corresponding entry in the
  Protein Data Bank (PDB)</li>
  <li><span style="color: #0C0C78; font-weight: bold;">Dark blue</span> -- transcript has been
  reviewed or validated by either the RefSeq or SwissProt staff</li>
  <li><span style="color: #5050A0; font-weight: bold;">Medium blue</span> -- other RefSeq
  transcripts</li>
  <li><span style="color: #8282D2; font-weight: bold;">Light blue</span> -- non-RefSeq
  transcripts</li>
</ul>

<p>
This track contains an optional <a target="_blank"
href="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">codon coloring feature</a> that allows users to
quickly validate and compare gene predictions. There is also an option to display the data as 
a <a target="_blank" href="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">density graph</a>, which
can be helpful for visualizing the distribution of items over a region.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
All the GENCODE genes in the comprehensive set are downloaded from the GENCODE 
<a href="https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/">website</a>.  
Data from other sources are correlated with the GENCODE data to build the <i>knownTo_</i> tables.
</p>


<h2>Related Data</h2>
<p>
The GENCODE Genes transcripts are annotated in numerous tables. These
include tables that link GENCODE Genes transcripts to external datasets (such as
<i>knownToLocusLink</i>, which maps GENCODE Genes transcripts to Entrez identifiers, previously
known as Locus Link identifiers), and tables that detail some property of GENCODE Genes transcript
sequences (such as <i>knownToPfam</i>, which identifies any Pfam domains found in the GENCODE Genes
protein-coding transcripts).</p>

<p>
One can see a full list of the associated tables by clicking the <a target="_blank" 
href="/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=mm10&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=knownGene&hgta_table=knownGene&hgta_doSchema=describe+table+schema">
View table schema</a> link at the top of the page, or in the
<a target="_blank" href="/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> by selecting GENCODE Genes from the <b>track</b> menu;
this list is then available on the <b>table</b> menu. Note that some of these tables refer to
GENCODE Genes by its table name <i>knownGene</i>, sometimes abbreviated as <i>known</i> or
<i>kg</i>. While the complete set of annotation tables is too long to describe, some of the more
important tables are described below.</p>
<ul> 
  <li> <b>kgXref</b> identifies the RefSeq, SwissProt, Rfam, or tRNA sequences (if any) which are 
  associated with each transcript.</li>
  <li> <b>knownToRefSeq</b> identifies the RefSeq transcript that each GENCODE Genes transcript is
  most closely associated with. That RefSeq transcript is the RefSeq transcript that the GENCODE
  Genes transcript overlaps at the most bases.</li>  
  <li> <b>knownGeneMrna</b> contains the genomic sequence for each of the GENCODE Genes models. 
  This may not be the same as the actual mRNA used to validate the gene model.</li>
  <li> <b>knownGenePep</b> contains the protein sequences derived from the knownGeneMrna transcript
  sequences. Any protein-level annotations, such as the contents of the knownToPfam table, are based
  on these sequences.</li>
  <li> <b>knownIsoforms</b> maps each transcript to a <em>cluster ID</em>, a cluster of isoforms of
  the same gene.</li>
  <li> <b>knownCanonical</b> identifies the canonical isoform of each cluster ID or gene using the 
  ENSEMBL gene IDs to define each cluster. The canonical transcript is chosen using the APPRIS 
  principal transcript when available.  
  If no APPRIS tag exists for any transcript associated with the cluster, then a transcript in the 
  BASIC set is chosen. If no BASIC transcript exists, then the longest isoform is used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data access</h2>

<p>
GENCODE Genes and its associated tables can be explored interactively using the

as seen in the <a target="_blank" 
href="/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=mm10&hgta_group=genes&hgta_track=knownGene&hgta_table=knownGene&hgta_doSchema=describe+table+schema">
View table schema</a> page, the 
knownGene.txt.gz file in the downloads directory contains a compressed version of the data. All 
the tables can also be queried directly from our public MySQL servers. Information on accessing 
this data through MySQL can be found on our <a target="_blank" href="/goldenPath/help/mysql.html">
help page</a> as well as on <a target="_blank" href="https://genome-blog.gi.ucsc.edu/blog/tag/mysql/">
