<H3>Description</H3>
<P>
This track shows the location of the consensus and exemplar sequences used 
for the selection of probes on the Affymetrix HG-U133A and HG-U133B chips.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>
Consensus and exemplar sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=hgu133" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A>
and mapped to the genome using blat followed by pslReps with the 
parameters: <PRE><TT>   -minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005
</TT></PRE></P>
