- handle HTS for terry

- change download to generate single md5 for pair of .gbff and .fsa

- lock some table during update (gbStatus).

- update naming between refseq and genbank should be made consistent,
  maybe include date in full?

- entries duplicated in updates get aligned multiple times, end up
  in index multiple times.  Need to make sure doesn't get loaded
  multiple times (see "AF530914")

- testing:
     - download, process
     - test/make-test-download

- selectVer field use is more limited, can it be dropped?

- clean up hgRelate junk

- all error messages with update should include the release too.
  - use common method.

- skip alignment if sequence is already outdated in an update?

- gb reference, authors, journal may occur multiple times, only first
  kept.  Renable warning in readOneField to get list.

- need to remove align work directory (with option to keep by date).

- **** deal with not downloading outdated refseq dailies.  Makesure that
       when the same version/moddate is in full and an daily, that
       full wins (this appears to not be the case).

- delete hgRefSeqStatus.c, hgRefSeqMrna

- get image clones ids (already in table, need to analyze and maybe
  split in seperate fields).

- gbSanity:
      - add check of sequence in fasta

- keep versions in accesion tables

- need to verify that all of the features that can contain db_xref attributes
  are handled by gbToFaRa (or we just select the onces we are interested in).

- check that we still have matt's change to not abort on a bad extFile table.

- delete hgRefSeqStatus

- add checks of refFlat, refGene, refAlign

- figure out how to pipe lift in gbAlignFinish

- gbGetTest creates empty .seq files, and not gziped ones

- AJ431705 - a EST in gbest28.seq.gz,
   error in  download/genbank.132.0/daily-nc/nc1113.flat.gz, made it an
   mrna.  (latter corrected);

- why does reflink store product names as both id and string,
  also annoying that id doesn't follow convention of other tables
  that the name is the same.

- gbBlat location in alignment job file may not be valid if run on
  a different machine.

- empty processed fasta files are created.


- build geneName table for Fan from /gene= features.
        http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/
        http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/public-files/nomen/nomeids.txt
   Issues:
       Names with spaces: AB005521S1 /gene="ppar gamma"

       Multiple names: AB001517 /gene="TMEM1", /gene="PWP2", /gene="KNP-I"


- looks like refseq locus can have multiple accessions!!
        LOCUS       AOC2
        ACCESSION   NM_009590
                             /gene="AOC2"
        ACCESSION   NC_001776
        ACCESSION   NC_002184
        
- *** raToFaRa needs to parse multiple gene names, which might contain
      spaces  refseq gene name perhaps should be locus rather than 
      /gene=.  Old used CDS /gene= name.

  -   For NM_130786 (reviewed), we have
        LOCUS       A1BG
        gene            1..3386
                     /gene="A1BG"

             gene            1..1065
                     /gene="ABO"

      For hugo CCRN4L ->AF183961, NM_012118

             CDS             <1..>854
                     /gene="robo2"

- specify --buffer-size for the gbAlignFinish sort commands.

- somehow report gbLoadRna warnings.

- what would be required to use a database for data:
   - browser db would have to have copy of databases to do select.
   
- make blat take coordinates to extract from nib.

- put hgLoadTabFile bacl to the way it was if we don't use any more.

- index access patterns:
   * could we used entries that have just the lates processed and latest
     aligned?  Think we need processed matching aligned version.
   - processed - just creates index files, doesn't read.
   - gbAlignGet
        - does one update at a time, 
        - loads processed for current release.
        - if full, loads previous release aligned for genome (not processed)
        - loads current processed (but not aligned, since working on an
          unaligned update).
        - foreach processed entry in update:
          gbUpdateFindNeedAligned:
            - check if proc-entry is new or version changed in this update
              - if have prevAligned, check prev aligned entry.
        - foreach fastaRec, check if entry to see if selected.
      **  this could load a single processed update at a time, but needs
          entire previous aligned.

   - gbAlignInstall:
        - does one update at a time, 
        - loads processed for current release.
        - if full, loads previous release aligned for genome (not processed)
        - gbUpdateFindNeedAligned:
           - to traverse processed + prevAlign and find
             all entries to migrate in current alignment.
        - foreach prevUpdate, traverse psls and check if flagged for migration
        - traverse psl, and save flagged
        - gbUpdateFindNeedAligned - build index

   - gbLoadRna
        - load processed and aligned.
        - load status table and add aux info:
           - load gbStatus  *big*
           - foreach gbStatus selected 
                - not in aligned -> mark deleted
                - version increased -> mark seqChg
                - modDate increased -> mark metaChg
                - else -> mark noChg
           - foreach aligned
                - not in gbStatus -> mark new
           - foreach seq not in gbStatus 
                - flag orphaned
        - read ra files

   - gbSanity
        - 

- Combine type and source DB in gbStatusTbl in the same manner as seq
  or make seq compatbile???

- should be able to load aligned/processed for one update?? maybe not
  always useful because of metaDataChg being in differet update.

- `select' struct and `select' flag names confusing

- check size of hash tables

- reruning gbAlignSetup on partially completed jobs doesn't appear to
  generate a subset.  Also, there is no way to check if it completed
  anyway, sicne we don't make jobs without output.  Probably need
  a sanit ycheck.

- need to make sure we have new version of programs:
   - pslReps
   - liftUp
   - hgLoadPsl
   - pslIntronsOnly

- mrna names are varchar(255), could probably be shorter.

- frequnt failures doing download; nd a retry mchanism.

- perl error message are a bit ugly due to trap shit.

- have alignFinish write files direcly, then install index from them.
  Saves one I/O pass.

- add sanity check for having someintron psls

- mrnaClone table is huge, maybe shouldn't be a unique string table.


- PENDING TASKS
   - deployment doc

- should refseq pep sequences be in gbStatus?

- double .tmp: ls processed/genbank.132.0/full/
   mrna.fa.tmp.tmp  mrna.fil.tmp  mrna.gbidx.tmp  mrna.ra.tmp

- `delete outdated alignments' alignment message should be entery/level

- gbLoadRna should generate errors in some cases where nothing is done.

- add doc about the way to correct a full download with a corrupt file
  is to remove the corrupt file and the *.md5 file.

- gbLoadRna - don't generabte delet outdate, etc message if there are
  no outdated.

- it would be nice to have each aligned update have all of the
  sequences in it aligned, even if they are not seqChg or now.  This
  would make removing an update less damaging.  Maybe migrate from
  other update???

- build list of refseqs without dbref for mim and send to ncbi

- **** Have some limit to prevent deleting large number of entries

- reflink diffs:
    - ~92 refseqs (132.0) don't have OMIM IDS because the
        gbff don't have FEATURES/gene/db_xref="MIM:191195"
      need to report this to ncbi

- **** Corrupt (truncated) alidx created and not detected.  Not sure
       how this happened or how to detect.  sqlnum didn't report error
       was part of the problems.  Maybe reread after writing, but before
       closing???

- Determine if all refseqs should have mim/locus links ids, and if so, report
  as an error.

- add better bookkeeping during the alignment process, keeping lists
  of acc that aligned or did not align, where they aligned and 
  ones that need migrated.  Also add bookkeeping for intronPsl

- chagne est-intron check to include other splice sites.

- need method to migrate links

- blat tmp file for  chrX.nib:chrX_5:39292303-56445259 is /var/tmp/gbBlat.19070.tmp/chrX_5.psl

- psl and oi can end up in different order if multiple align to the same loc.

- selectOrientInfo doesn't take into account multiple alignments of
  the same acc at the same look, so OI ends up larger
    - fix #ifdef-ed check in gbAlignInstall

- aligned files should be write protected and checksumed

- finish align version is a bit weird; gbAlignInstall makes noise
  all of the time, but the higher-level script doesn't, which is 
   a bit confusing to debug.

- report mRNA that is really intergenic

- add data/ route for directory

### Task list ###
  - cleanup of load directory
  - make sure index files are carefully check for write errors, we
    have acopuple of trauncated ones, also when parse.
  - add processing of HTS sets

- add checks for *.alidx files being there for *.gbidx.

- X63368.2, in genbank.133.0 gbpri23 is marked as a DNA.!

- fix paths in gbBlat

- move sqlTrace global to sqlConnection

- add some kind of complete flag for alignments

- Add sanity checks of release and update info in gbStatus.

- check indcex of gbStatus, seq (include extFile id).

- use blat, etc from our own directory.

- does seq table index typeSrcDbAcc2(type, srcDb, acc(2))),
  split so that it works without acc(2)


- looks like some are mm2 are `Mus musculus musculus'

- Update of file names:
  - if seq release is older than current release, but seq not changed,
    and to fa update list.
  - 

-make sure refseq prot fa gets updated with seq fa.

- *** Need to have a way to track alignment version, to handle realignment
  with different parameters.  

- refseq peptides are not deleted when no longer referenced

- keep our own copy of all progs

- refseq peptide sequences that are no longer refereced are not deleted
  and don't have their paths changed

- use para output checks for gbBlat

- don't do unneeded steps in dbload.

- always log state counts in gbLoadrna

- add indices to seq to speed up gbSanity.


-** these accessions had multiple portions of the mRNA align to the
    exact same range of the genome.  Check out why??>
    AF064839.1
    AK025862.1
    AK025986.1
      X98410.1

- Remove OI count check in migrate, due to above case.  We don't count
  intronPsls anyway.  Add sanity check that all intronPsls have psls
  and all psls have OIs..

- alignrun failes if nothing to align (not jobs file generated.  Should
  check.

- add better parameter validation to gbblat (require .psl.gz)

- -gbAlignInstall should print a message about what is being processed..

- add checks of database for initialLoad flag.

- both gbLoadRna and gbSanity have messages about `loading' tables, although
  having the oposite meaning.  Confusing.

- don't need to build xeno.alidx for refseq..

- either remove hgRefSeqMrna or change to use function now in genePred.h

- have scripts send reminder if semaphore files detected which are more than a 
  day old

- full implement gbSeq.version files, including adding to gbSanity

- add orgCat to gbStatus

- Make process/align files read-only
        also log files.

- *** Would be really good to figure out how to add a date to
      the genbank update directories.

- normalize verbose messages

- fix weird clone ids:
        AF072864	IMAGE:25838: 138-g24
        AB063297	IMAGE: 1837972  (space

        NM_020359	ac34a06.sl; IMAGE: 1375897

                
- should filter stuff be kept in gbToFaRa, or mayde command line??

- Make sure genePred conversions is sane with what Fan did

- add $root/var/ directory for logs and run files.

- is seq.gb_date really needed???

- allow filter to be specified on gbToFaRa cmd line.

- use explict paths to executables to make sure we don't pick up wrong ones.

- (AF201929) in the "SARS mRNA" track is actually a full murine hepatitus strain 2 viral genome (bad label in

- need a way to check if mgc tables are out-of-date.

- dealing with maxShrinkage errors is a pain, need to rerun by had to get list to
   check, then run again to override.

- lock gbStatus or gbLoaded during update, can be used as a check by
  other programs while not blocking browser

- alignment parameters

 slightly better to add -q=rna on the native mRNA as well. 

    refseq mrna: (drop -trimHardA)
         blat -q=rna -fine -ooc=/scratch/hg/h/11.ooc
         pslReps -minCover=0.15 -sizeMatters -minAli=0.98 -nearTop=0.001
    native mrna:

         pslReps -minAli=0.25
    xeno est:
         blat -q=dnax -t=dnax -mask=lower
         pslReps -minAli=0.10

- mgc tar file has abs paths

- hmm, looks like:refseq status are: Predicted,Provisional,Reviewed,Unknown
        -validated lost, also INFERRED,

- why doesn't gbLoadRna use the ignore tables from in gbRelease.

- dir structures
    doc/
    etc/
    test/
    src/

- *** Some refseqse don't have status: NC_001224  Is this ok??>
        - why does this get saved to begin with??

- add mgc gene name to mgcStatus.
   - need to handle MGC being select multiple times

- change nib glob to nib directory.

- errors can be hard to see in the log files:
  mkdir work/initial.ci1 at /cluster/store5/genbank/bin/../lib/gbCommon.pm line 176. at /cluster/store5/genbank/bin/../lib/gbCommon.pm line 176.

- make sure directorys have the group stick bit maintained.
