<P>
The location of each haplotype block is represented by
a blue horizontal line with tall vertical blue bars at the first and
last SNPs of the block. Blocks are displayed as starting at the first
SNP and ending at the last SNP of the block.  Individual SNPs are denoted by
smaller black vertical bars. At multi-megabase resolution in dense
display mode, clusters of tall blue bars may indicate hotspots for
recombination. </P>
<P>
NOTE: Haplotype block annotations appear only on chromosome 22.</P>
