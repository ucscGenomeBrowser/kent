<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This region was detected as a putative genomic duplication within the golden path.
     Orange, yellow, dark-light gray represent similarities of >99\%, 99-98\% and 98-90% 
     respectively. Duplications greater than 98% similarity that lack sufficient SDD 
     evidence (likely missed overlaps) are shown as red. Cut off values were at least 
     1 kb of total sequence aligned (containing at least 500 bp non-RepeatMasked sequence) 
     and at least 90% sequence identity.
