<P>
This track shows the draft assembly (Dec. 2009, TGC (NCBI Project ID: 10805, Accession: GCA_000146605.1))
of the $organism genome provided by the
Turkey Genome Consortium.<BR>

Please note description of this assembly in the genbank record:
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ADDD00000000"
TARGET=_blank>ADDD00000000.1</A>.<BR>


Whole-genome shotgun reads were assembled into contigs.  When possible, 
contigs were grouped into scaffolds (also known as &quot;supercontigs&quot;).
The order, orientation and gap sizes between contigs within a scaffold are
based on paired-end read evidence. </P>
<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</P>
<P>
Components in this track are of types:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;F&quot;: Finished sequence</LI>
<LI>&quot;W&quot;: WGS contig sequence</LI>
