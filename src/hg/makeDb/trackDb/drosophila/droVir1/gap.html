<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
<P>
Gap locations were extracted from the sequence by looking for 
stretches of at least 25 consecutive N bases.  
<P>
<P>Gaps were considered to be one of these two types, based on length:
<UL>
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps of size 50 Kb or fewer.
<LI><B>Scaffold</B> - gaps greater than 50 Kb in size. 
</UL>
