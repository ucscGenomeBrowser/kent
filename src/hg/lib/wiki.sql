# wiki.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated wiki.c and wiki.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Wiki link bed-like structure
CREATE TABLE wiki (
    chrom varchar(255) not null,	# Reference sequence chromosome or scaffold
    chromStart int unsigned not null,	# Start position in chromosome
    chromEnd int unsigned not null,	# End position in chromosome
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of item
    dummy int unsigned not null,	# dummy field to align with bed6 structure
    strand char(1) not null,	# + or -
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(chrom, chromStart, chromEnd)
