<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
Excerpted from the 
Vista Enhancer <A HREF="http://enhancer.lbl.gov/aboutproject.html" 
TARGET=_BLANK>Handbook and Methods</A> page at the Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory (LBNL) website:</P>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://enhancer.lbl.gov/" TARGET=_BLANK>VISTA Enhancer Browser</A> 
identifies distant-acting transcriptional enhancers in the human genome by 
coupling the identification of evolutionary conserved non-coding sequences with 
a moderate throughput mouse transgenesis enhancer assay.
</P>
<P>
The "Experimental Dataset" of conserved non-coding human sequences has been 
tested for enhancer activity in transgenic mice.
As of October 2006, approximately 300 elements were found in this portion of 
the database, and this number is expected to grow steadily. These sequences are 
based on UCSC human assembly hg17 (May 2004).
</P>
<P>
Non-coding elements identified as conserved in human, mouse, and rat are lifted
with primers, and the PCR fragment is cloned into a reporter vector that has a 
minimal promoter fused to LacZ.  This is then injected into a fertilized mouse 
egg and the 11.5 day embryo is assayed for activity with lacZ stain.  
Whole-embryo <em>in situ</em> pictures are available on the LBNL website..</P>
<P>
To be defined as a <EM>positive</EM> enhancer, an element has to show 
reproducible 
expression in the same structure in at least three independent transgenic 
embryos. An element is defined as <EM>negative</EM> if at least five 
transgenic embryos 
have been obtained, but no reproducible expression was observed in any structure
in at least three different embryos. </P>
<P>
Users should keep in mind that the assay captures only a single embryonic 
timepoint. A negative result reported in the experimental dataset does not 
necessarily imply that this conserved element is not a transcriptional 
enhancer, because it might be active at earlier or later timepoints in 
development.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Elements that tested <EM>positive</EM> are assigned a score of 900 and 
display in black
in the annotation track. Those that tested <EM>negative</EM> are given the 
score 200 and appear as light grey.</P>
