<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays genome wide localization of two transcription factors 
(USF1 and USF2) and acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) in a liver cell line (HepG2). 
ChIP was performed on three biological replicates and the samples were 
hybridized to Affymetrix arrays covering the human genome at an average 
resolution of 35 base pairs. In this track, identified positive regions are
presented for each factor. The companion track, <em>Uppsala ChIP Signal</em>, 
shows average probe level intensities for each factor.

The raw data for this track is available at 
<A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress" TARGET=_blank>EBI ArrayExpress</A>
, as experiment E-TABM-314.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described 
(Rada-Iglesias et al. 2005), but sonication conditions were optimized to 
obtain smaller fragments (approximately 300 bp), to further improve the 
resolution of our experiments. The antibodies against USF1 (H-86, sc-8983) 
and USF2 (C-20, sc-862) were from Santa Cruz biotechnology; anti-Histone H3 
acetyl K9/14 (06-599) and normal rabbit IgG (12-370) were purchased from 
Upstate. Three completely independent biological replicates were performed 
for each antibody, obtaining the corresponding input as total genomic DNA 
reference. Hybridizations were performed using Affymetrix GeneChip Human 
Tiling 2.0R Array set (7 arrays set). Array data files for USF1, USF2, H3ac 
and IgG were normalized against corresponding Input arrays using Affymetrix 
Tiling Array Software (TAS) two-group normalization. An empirical Bayes 
algorithm was used to ensure that identified positive regions for USF1, USF2 
and H3ac show low enrichment of IgG.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
54 regions were selected to be analyzed by qPCR using new ChIP DNA obtained 
using USF1 (C20 and H86) and USF2 antibodies. Of those 54 regions, 6 were 
negative for both USF proteins and were used to set background/cut-off 
thresholds. For the remaining 48 regions all but one was positive both for 
USF1 and USF2 (with that unique negative region being different for USF1 and 
USF2). Furthermore, there was a high correlation (R=0,79-0,85) between the 
enrichments levels determined microarray hybridizations and qPCR.
