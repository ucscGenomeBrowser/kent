<p>
The definition of the gaps in this assembly is from the AGP file:
<a href="/gbdb/hubs/mouseStrains/GCA_001624445.1_CAST_EiJ_v1/GCA_001624445.1_CAST_EiJ_v1.agp.gz" target=_blank>GCA_001624445.1_CAST_EiJ_v1.agp.gz</a><br>
The NCBI document

<p>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</p>
<p>
This assembly has 48,311 gaps, with the following principal types of gaps:
<ul>
<li><B>scaffold</B> - gaps between scaffolds in chromosome assemblies (count: 48,311; size range: 11 - 10,000 bases)</li>
</ul></p>
