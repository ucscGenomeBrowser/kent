<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows regions
where transcription factors, proteins responsible for
modulating gene transcription, bind to DNA as assayed by ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies 
specific to the transcription factor followed by sequencing of the precipitated DNA).
Additional views of this dataset and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeTfBindingSuper>ENC TF Binding Supertrack</A> page.
The peaks were computed using a uniform pipeline developed by Anshul Kundaje that uses the
variation between the two replicates to develop sensible peak thresholds. This track combines
data from many different cell lines and transcription-factor targeting antibodies into a
relatively dense display.

<p>
A gray box encompasses the peaks of transcription factor occupancy.  The darkness of the box 
is proportional to the maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  The name to the left
of the box is the transcription factor. The letters to the right represent the cell lines where
a signal is detected.  The darkness of the letter is proportional to the signal strength in
the cell line. Click on an item in the track to see the cell lines spelled out.
