NOTES:

Be sure to update visiGene.fileLocation before pushing to hgwbeta/RR:
hgsql visiGene
 update fileLocation set name=replace(name,'http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu','http://genome.ucsc.edu')

To compile hgVisiGene cgi with DEBUG flag, do this:
  make clean
  make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG
This turns on support for using bigImageTest.html in place of bigImage.html  

bigImage.html was moved to hg/htdocs/
dot_clear.gif was moved to hg/htdocs/images/
