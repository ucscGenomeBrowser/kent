#	hgsql -e "select genome from defaultDb;" hgcentral
# If you need a different version of that specific genome, change

# trackDb table to use. A simple value of `trackDb' is normally sufficient.
# In general, the value is a comma-separated list of trackDb format tables to
# search.  This supports local tracks combined with a mirror of the trackDb
# table from UCSC. The names should be in the form `trackDb_suffix'. This
# implies a parallel hgFindSpec format search table exists in the form
# hgFindSpec_suffix.  The specified trackDb tables are searched in the order
# specified, with the first occurance of a track being used.  You may associate
# trackDb/hgFindSpec tables with other instances of genome databases using a
# specification of profile:trackDbTbl, where profile is the name of a
# databases profile in hg.conf, and trackDbTbl is the name of the table in the
# remote databases.

# Database profiles
##
#   The dbProfile facility provides a limited mechanism for access tracks from
# multiple database servers.  This is particularly useful when a mirror server
# contains the majority of the track data needs to be shared by multiple
# groups with a small number of locally produced tracks that they the need to
# keep isolated from the other groups.  A dbProfile associates a MySQL host,
# user, and password with a dbProfile name.  To define a dbProfile named
# myProfile, define the hg.conf variables:
#
#    myProfile.host
#    myProfile.user
#    myProfile.host
#
# The default profile is named `db', and is defined by the `db.*' variables
# described above.  The `customTracks.*' and `central.*' variables also define
# profiles.
#
# Profiles can be associated with an entire genome databases or some types of
# tables.  To associated with a database, myGenome with myProfile, define the
# variable:
#     myGenome.profile=myProfile
#
# A dbProfile may be associated with a trackDb/hgFindSpec table pair or a grp
# table as described in the `db.trackDb' and `db.grp' variables above.  To
# associate a particular track table, specify the "dbProfile" setting in the
# trackDb entry:
#
#    track myTrack
#    ...
#    dbProfile myProfile
#
# Note that dbProfile only works on a small number of track types and is not
# well tested.  In general, the dbProfile facility has not been widely use and
# may still contain bugs.  The recommended approach for setting up a
# remote/local server pair is to use the default profile for the remote server
# with the majority of tracks, and use a non-default profile for local tracks
# and trackDb tables.  A common configuration would be:

#db.host=oursharedhost
#db.user=readonly
#db.password=access
#
#myStuff.host=localhost
#myStuff.user=readonly
#myStuff.password=access
#
#db.trackDb=myStuff:trackDb,trackDb
#db.grp=myStuffgrp,grp
