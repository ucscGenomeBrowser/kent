<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows putative binding loci of c-Myc and STAT1 as determined 
by Sequence Tag Analysis of Genomic Enrichment (STAGE). 
The c-Myc (cellular myelocytomatosis) protein is a transcription 
factor associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and
neoplastic disease. STAT1 is a signal transducer and transcription
factor that binds to IFN-gamma activating sequence.</P>
<P>
STAGE was performed in HeLa cells under normal growth conditions
(10% Fetal Bovine Serum) with anti-Myc, or in IFN-gamma stimulated
cells with anti-STAT1 antibody. 

Cloned STAGE tags were sequenced and mapped to the human genome as described in 
Kim <em>et al.</em> (2005), referenced below. </P>
<P>
The Tags subtrack shows all STAGE tags within the ENCODE region and thus 
represents the raw data. 
The Peaks subtrack shows high confidence c-Myc binding  
regions derived from the STAGE tags.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks.  To display only one of the subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the 
track you wish to hide.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Each tag was assigned a probability of enrichment calculated 
from the frequency of occurrence of the tag in the 
STAGE sequencing pool and the number of times the tag is present in 
the genome, assuming a binomial distribution. 
Generally, tags that have a low frequency of occurrence in the sequencing
pool and a high genomic frequency were assigned low probabilities of enrichment.
<P>
Peaks were determined by using a 500 bp window to scan across each chromosome. 
Each window was assigned a probability based on the tags mapped 
within that window as described in Bhinge <em>et al.</em> referenced below.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
For c-Myc, scores generated from the real data were compared to
simulations where similar numbers of tags were randomly sampled from the genome.
Calculating probabilities as above, a probability cut-off of 0.8 gave a false 
positive rate of less than 0.05.</P>
<P>
For STAT1, scores generated from the real data were compared to
simulations  where similar numbers of tags were randomly sampled
 from the genome.
Calculating probabilities as described, a probability cut-off of 0.95 gave a false positive rate of less than 0.01.
Additionally, 10 STAGE-detected STAT1 binding sites were assayed 
by qPCR analysis and 9 out 10 were confirmed as true positives, so
the false positive rate is estimated at 10%.
