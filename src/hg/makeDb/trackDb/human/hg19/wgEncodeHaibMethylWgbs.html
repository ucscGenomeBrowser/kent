<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track is produced as part of the ENCODE project. The track reports the percentage of DNA molecules that exhibit cytosine methylation.  In general, DNA methylation within a gene's promoter is associated with gene silencing, and DNA methylation within the exons and introns of a gene is associated with gene expression.  Proper regulation of DNA methylation is essential during development and aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer.  DNA methylation status is assayed with Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS).  Genomic DNA is sheared by sonication, end repaired and ligated to methylated sequencing adapters.  The library fragments are treated with sodium bisulfite and amplified by PCR to convert every unmethylated cytosine to a thymidine while leaving methylated cytosines intact.  The sequenced fragments are aligned to a bisulfite converted reference genome. For each assayed cytosine the number of sequencing reads covering that C and the percentage of those reads that are methylated were reported.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
Methylation status is represented with an 11-color gradient using the following convention:
<ul>
<li> <span style="background-color:#FF0000;width:150px;">red</span> = 100% of molecules sequenced are methylated</span>
<li> <span style="background-color:#FFFF00">yellow</span> = 50% of molecules sequenced are methylated</span>
<li> <span style="background-color:#00FF00">green</span> = 0% of molecules sequenced are methylated</span>
</ul>

<p>
Methylation is reported in two tracks: CpG and non-CpG (cytosines that are not followed by a guanine).  The score in this track reports the number of sequencing reads obtained for each C, which is often called 'coverage'.  Score is capped at 1000 and any Cs that are covered by more than 1000 sequencing reads have a score of 1000.  The bed files available for download contain two extra columns, one with the uncapped coverage (number of reads at that cover that site), and one with the percentage of those reads that show methylation.  We have found that with bisulfite sequencing, high reproducibility is obtained when considering CpGs represented by at least 10 sequencing reads (10x coverage, score=10). Therefore, the default view for this track is set to 10X coverage, or a score of 10.

<a name="Methods"></a><h2>Methods</h2>
<p>DNA methylation at cytosines across the genome was assayed with Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS).  WGBS was performed on cell lines grown by ENCODE production groups.  WGBS was carried out by the Myers production group at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology.

<h3>Isolation of genomic DNA</h3>
<p>Genomic DNA is isolated from each cell line using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  DNA concentrations for each genomic DNA preparation are determined using fluorescent DNA binding dye and a fluorometer (Invitrogen Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and Qubit Fluorometer).  Typically, 2 µg of genomic DNA is used to make WGBS libraries.
</p>

<h3>WGBS library construction and sequencing</h3>
<p>
WGBS library construction starts with sonication of genomic DNA on a Covaris S2 instrument.  Sheared ends are then repaired and blunted with DNA polymerase I, T4 DNA polymerase and T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of dATP, dGTP and dTTP.  After end repair, Klenow exo- DNA Polymerase is used to add an adenosine as a 3' overhang. Next, a methylated version of the Illumina paired-end adapters is ligated onto the DNA.  Adapter ligated genomic DNA fragments of 400 base pairs are selected using a 2% agarose SizeSelect E-gel.  The selected adapter-ligated fragments are treated with sodium bisulfite using the Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils and leaves methylated cytosines unchanged.  Bisulfite treated DNA is amplified in a final PCR reaction which has been optimized to uniformly amplify diverse fragment sizes and sequence contexts in the same reaction. During this final PCR reaction uracils are copied as thymines resulting in a thymine in the PCR products wherever an unmethylated cytosine existed in the genomic DNA.  The sample is now ready for sequencing on the Illumina sequencing platform.  These libraries were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommendations as paired-end 50 base pair reads.  Libraries were sequenced to a depth of 600 million aligned reads.

<h3>Data analysis</h3>
<p>To analyze the sequence data, the <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/bismark/program">Bismark</A> (Krueger and Andrews, 2011) was used to align sequences reads.  Generally, each read went through a conversion of C's to T's, then underwent alignment to fully converted plus and minus strands of the hg19 build of the human genome.  A few custom refinements were made to the Bismark program.  Since these libraries were made in a directional orientation with the first read always being C-poor, we skipped unnecessary alignments to impossible orientations.  We also implemented a more stringent uniqueness filter, only allowing reads that have one acceptable alignment (based on default bowtie parameters) across both strands.  Once reads were aligned, the percent methylation was calculated for each cytosine using the original sequence reads. The percent methylation and number of reads is reported for each CpG in the wgEncodeHaibMethylWgbsXXXXCpg.bigBed file and for each non CpG cytosine in the wgEncodeHaibMethylWgbsXXXXNoncpg.bigBed file.</p>
