<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays tRNA genes predicted by using 
<A HREF="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/" TARGET=_blank>tRNAscan-SE</A> v.1.23. 
</P>
<P>
tRNAscan-SE is an integrated program that uses tRNAscan (Fichant) and an A/B box motif detection 
algorithm (Pavesi) as pre-filters to obtain an initial list of tRNA candidates. 
The program then filters these candidates with a covariance model-based 
search program <A HREF="ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/cove/" TARGET=_blank>
COVE</A> (Eddy) to obtain a highly specific set of primary sequence 
and secondary structure predictions that represent 99-100% of true tRNAs 
with a false positive rate of fewer than 1 per 15 gigabases.</P>
<P>
Detailed tRNA annotations for eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea are available at
<A HREF="http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu" TARGET=_blank>Genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb)</A>. 
</P>
<P>
What does the tRNAscan-SE score mean?  Anything with a score above 20 bits is likely to be
<I>derived</I> from a tRNA, although this does not indicate whether the tRNA gene still encodes a 
functional tRNA molecule (i.e. tRNA-derived SINES probably do not function in the ribosome in translation).
Vertebrate tRNAs with scores of >60.0 (bits) are likely to encode functional tRNA genes, and 
those with scores below ~45 have sequence or structural features that indicate they probably are
no longer involved in translation.  tRNAs with scores between 45-60 bits are in the "grey" zone, and may
or may not have all the required features to be functional.  In these cases, tRNAs should be inspected
carefully for loss of specific primary or secondary structure features (usually in alignments with other
genes of the same isotype), in order to make a better educated guess.  These rough score range guides 
are not exact, nor are they based on specific biochemical studies of atypical tRNA features,
so please treat them accordingly.
