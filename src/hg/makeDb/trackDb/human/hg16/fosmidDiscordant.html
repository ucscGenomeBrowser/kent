<P>

This track shows 285 sites of intermediate-sized structural variation (ISV) detected by 
mapping paired end-sequences from a human fosmid DNA library against the July 2003 assembly (build34) 
of the human genome. 

The average resolution of this technique is ~8 kb, and includes 56 sites of inversion 
not detectable by array-based approaches. 

However, because of the physical constraints of fosmid insert size, this technique is unable to 
detect insertions greater than 40 kb in size.
