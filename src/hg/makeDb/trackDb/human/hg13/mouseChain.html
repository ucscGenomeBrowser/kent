<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows mouse/$organism genomic alignments using
a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps than traditional
affine gap scoring systems.  It can also tolerate gaps
in both mouse and $organism simultaneously.  These &quot;double-sided&quot;
gaps can be caused by local inversions and overlapping deletions
in both species. The mouse sequence is from the Feb. 2003 (mm3)
assembly.</P>
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or 
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions. Single lines 
indicate gaps that are largely due to missing sequence in the 
non-$organism species. Double lines represent gaps due to non-aligning 
sequence present in both species.  In cases where there are multiple 
chains over a particular portion of the $organism genome, chains with 
single-lined gaps often are due to processed pseudogenes, while chains 
with double-lined gaps are more often due to paralogs and non-prodessed 
pseudogenes.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Transposons that have been inserted since the mouse/$organism
split are removed,  and the resulting abbreviated genomes are
aligned with blastz.  The transposons are then put back into the
alignments.  The resulting alignments are converted into axt format
and the resulting axts are fed into axtChain.  AxtChain organizes all 
the alignments between a single mouse and a single $organism chromosome,
into a group,  and makes a kd-tree out of all the gapless subsections
(blocks) of the alignments.  Next, maximally scoring chains of these
blocks are found by running a dynamic program over the kd-tree.  Chains
scoring below a threshold are discarded, and the remaining chains are
displayed here.</P>
