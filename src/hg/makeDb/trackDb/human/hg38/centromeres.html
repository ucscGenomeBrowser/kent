Track indicating the location of the centromere sequences.
Centromeres are specialized chromatin structures that are required for cell division.  These
genomic regions are normally defined by long tracts of tandem repeats, or satellite DNA, that
contain a limited number of sequence differences to distinguish the linear order of repeat copies.
The size and repetitive nature of these regions mean they are typically not represented in
reference assemblies.  Unlike all previous versions of the human reference assembly, where the
centromere regions have been represented by a multi-megabase gap, GRCh38 incorporates centromere
reference models that provide an initial genomic description derived from chromosome-assigned whole
genome shotgun (WGS) read libraries of alpha satellite.

<p>
Each reference model provides an approximation of the true array sequence organization.
Although the long-range repeat ordering is not expected to represent the true organization,
the submissions are expected to provide a biologically rich description of array variants and
local-monomer organization as observed in the initial WGS read dataset.  As a result, these
sequences serve as a useful mapping target to extend sequence-based studies to sites previously
omitted from the human reference genome.
