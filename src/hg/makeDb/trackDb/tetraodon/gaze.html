<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows Genoscope gene model annotations from the 
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/gaze" TARGET=_blank>GAZE</A> program written by Kevin Howe.  These annotations were computed using GAZE 
with a custom designed gene model. GAZE integrates information from Geneid, 
Genscan, Exofish (Human, Mouse and Fugu), Genewise (Human and Mouse) and 
Tetraodon cDNAs.

GAZE was run on masked Tetraodon genomic DNA using parameters calibrated for 
the Tetraodon genome.
