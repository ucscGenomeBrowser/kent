<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the Fugu v.3.0 (Aug. 2002) whole genome shotgun assembly 
provided by the <A HREF="http://jgi.doe.gov/" TARGET=_blank>US 
DOE Joint Genome Institute</A> (JGI). The assembly was constructed with the JGI
assembler, JAZZ, from paired end sequencing reads produced at JGI, Myriad 
Genetics, and Celera Genomics, resulting in a sequence coverage of 5.7X. All reads are
plasmid, cosmid, or BAC end sequences, with the predominant coverage
derived from 2 Kb insert plasmids. This assembly contains 20,379
scaffolds totaling 319 million base pairs. The largest 679 scaffolds
total 160 million base pairs.

The scaffolds in the display are ordered numerically using the
scaffold numbering provided by JGI.  The Genome Browser depicts the Fugu 
genome as a single unordered chromosome with 1000 bp scaffold gaps, which are 
shown in the Gap track annotation.  The scaffolds decrease in size as 
the scaffold number increases. Scaffold #1 is the largest.
