<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the draft assembly (Feb. 2011, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Devil_ref v7.0 (GCA_000189315.1))
of the $organism genome.

Many of these gaps &mdash; with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps &mdash; may be closed during the
finishing process.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between the Whole Genome Shotgun contigs of a 
supercontig.  (In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.  
A supercontig is a set of contigs ordered and oriented during the 
Whole Genome Shotgun process using paired-end reads.)
These are represented by varying numbers of <em>N</em>s  in the assembly.  
Fragment gap sizes are usually taken from read pair data.  
<li><b>Other</b> - Gaps of varying size marked with Ns in the sequence that were
not annotated in the AGP assembly definition file.</li>
</ul>
