<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows locations of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
on the Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array.  The SNPs in this track include
all of the markers from the array that have been successfully mapped
against the current assembly.</P>

<P>The SNPs were selected from public domain databases. Genotypes for
these markers were generated at Affymetrix using GeneChip(r) DNA
analysis technology and are available at their site.</P>
