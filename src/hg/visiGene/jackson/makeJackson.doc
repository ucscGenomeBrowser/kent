# JACKSON LABS Sybase database mgd

# 2005-06-15 (galt)

# Scripts are currently in /cluster/home/galt/jackson

# These scripts end up calling utility script query
#  which handles using sqsh utility (sql-shell) from sqsh.org.
#  sqsh was compiled --with-static and placed in /cluster/bin/i386/
#  it uses freetds from freetds.org for free libraries to connect 
#  to sybase.  sqsh also requires this in your home directory:
#[hgwdev:~> cat .freetds.conf
#[global]
#        host = gondor.informatics.jax.org
#	        port = 4025
#
#  The freebcp (bulk copy) utility which comes with freetds is 
#  used to dump all the rows from sybase - unfortunately
#  freebcp does not have a static-compile option handy.

setenv jdb jackson20060125

# make database jackson on dev
hgsql hg17 -e "create database $jdb"

# Transferring table structure and data from jackson
#  this calls gettable (7 hours)
getAllTables

# Transferring Index keys from jackson
#  this calls getindex
getAllIndexes (took 2days - use kolossus next time)

# Transerring images from jackson
#  this calls getimage
getAllImages  (took 3 hours to download almost 8k images)
# Currently these images are saved to /san/sanvol1/scratch/visiGene/downloads/jackson/$jdb/
# Now using this relationship uncovered by Jim which is much nicer:
#> mysql> select accID,_Object_key from ACC_Accession where
#> accID="PIX:5908";
#> +----------+-------------+
#> | accID    | _Object_key |
#> +----------+-------------+
#> | PIX:5908 |        8576 |
#> +----------+-------------+

# hgwdev:~jackson>hgsql jackson -BN -e 'select count(*) from ACC_Accession where prefixPart = "PIX:"'
# 7997
#
#hgsql $jdb -BN -e 'select substring(accID,5) from ACC_Accession where prefixPart = "PIX:"' > pixIds.list
# 

# Of course the data is live and they get new stuff deposited every week,
#  we don't at this time have a live update process but each table in jackson
#  has columns created and modified that are date-time.  We can use this
#  for an incremental db update.

============================================

Be sure to run ANALYZE TABLE on at least this set of key 
tables, otherwise vgLoadJax will be horrendously slow.

ANALYZE TABLE MRK_Marker;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_Assay;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_Specimen;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_InSituResult;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_InSituResultImage;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_FixationMethod;
ANALYZE TABLE GXD_EmbeddingMethod;
ANALYZE TABLE IMG_ImagePane;
ANALYZE TABLE IMG_Image;
ANALYZE TABLE ACC_Accession;
