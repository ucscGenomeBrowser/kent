<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the 
DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; that is a 
universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The Regulome tracks annotate continuous DNaseI sensitivity measurements and 
DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) over ENCODE regions. The data were produced 
using quantitative chromatin profiling (QCP) (Dorschner <em>et al.</em>, 2004).
</P>
<P>
In QCP, ~250 bp PCR amplicons are tiled end-to-end across study regions. 
High-throughput real-time PCR is used to quantify DNaseI at each amplicon by
measuring copies remaining in DNaseI-treated <em>vs.</em> untreated samples.
The results are then analyzed with a statistical algorithm to compute the
moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity and to identify outliers that
correspond with DNaseI hypersensitive sites.</P>

<H4>Cell lines/phenotypes studied</H4>
<P>
DNaseI-treated and untreated chromatin samples from the following cell
lines/phenotypes were studied:
<UL>
<LI>GM06990 (lymphoblastoid; all regions)</LI>
<LI>CaCo2 (intestinal; most regions)</LI>
<LI>SK-N-SH (neural; most regions)</LI>
<LI>HepG2 (hepatic; ENm003/Apolipoprotein A1 locus)</LI>
<LI>Huh7 (hepatic; ENm003, ENr131, ENr213, ENr321)</LI>
<LI>K562 (erythroid; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
<LI>ERY (CD34-derived primary adult erythroblasts; ENm009/Beta-globin locus)</LI>
</UL></P>
<P>
This track shows the moving baseline of mean DNaseI sensitivity, 
computed over each amplicon using a locally-weighted least squares 
(LOWESS)-based algorithm described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>.
The displayed values are calculated as <TT>1/(copies in DNaseI treated / copies 
in DNaseI untreated)</TT>. Thus, increasing values represent increasing 
sensitivity.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>.  
An amplicon tiling path has been computed over all regions and is available 
through <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=unists"
TARGET=_blank>UniSTS</A>. Chromatin preparation and DNaseI treatment were 
performed on the aforementioned cell types as described in Dorschner 
<em>et al</em>. </P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
<P>
QCP measurements were performed in replicate (6X) on pooled biological
replicate samples.  Validation of the results was carried out by conventional
DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern blotting. A total of
1.17 Mb have been evaluated by conventional assay. </P>
<P>
The specificity was defined as the number of true negative evaluable QCP
amplicons divided by the sum of the true negatives plus false positives. Using
246.2 Kb from ENm002, the specificity was calculated to be 0.997. The
sensitivity of the QCP assay was calculated as the true positives divided by
the sum of the true positives plus false negatives.  The sensitivity measured
for ENm002 was 0.9487.</P>

Data generation, analysis, and validation were performed jointly by groups at
Regulome Corporation and the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.</P>
