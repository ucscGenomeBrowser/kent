<H3>Description</H3>
This column shows the similarity of the expression of each gene 
to the selected gene. Genes with identical
expression profiles show a value of 0.
This column shows data only for the 1000 genes (including
splicing variants) that have the most similar expression
profiles.

<H3>Methods</H3>
The expression distance between two genes is a weighted
sum computed with the following formula:
<PRE>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delta(a,b) = sum(w[i] * |a[i] - b[i]| ) / sum(w[i])
</PRE>
where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are expression vectors associated with the two
genes indexed by tissue, <em>w</em> is an array of weights, and the
sums are taken over all tissues.  The values for the weights
are 1.0 for the tissues in this dataset.
