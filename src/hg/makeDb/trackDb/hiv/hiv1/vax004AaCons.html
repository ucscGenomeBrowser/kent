<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays conservation based on the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) 
results of VAX004 HIV-1 gp120 protein sequences (translated from the corresponding 
nucleotide sequences).
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<h3>Conservation</h3>
<P>
At each position of the MSA, the counts of different amino acids
were tallied and the frequency distribution calculated.  The most frequent 
residue at each position was used as the conservation measure.  
</P>

<h3>MSA method</h3>
<p>
Katoh <EM>et al.</EM> reported modifications of the MAFFT program 
which were used in these multiple alignments.  These modifications included 
two local (L-INS-i and E-INS-i) and one global (G-INS-i) iterative 
refinement algorithms.
MAFFT also incorporates a BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (an 
empirical matrix calculated from large datasets representing extreme protein 
family diversity) and assumes a fixed frequency for each AA for building MSAs; 
however, the estimated relative rates of changes in this matrix may be too 
general to fit datasets of specific gene families or high substitution rates, 
such as gp120. Hence, here we performed multiple MAFFT alignments using both the 
BLOSUM62 and gp120-specific scorings matrixes and/or fixed and variable AA 
frequencies estimated for the data at hand. Gene-specific empirical matrices and 
AA frequencies based on the VAX004 and LAGB-VAX004 datasets were generated via 
the program

</P>
<P>The quality of the MSA was then compared using the maximum likelihood (ML) 
tree building approach in PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel 2003) under the GTR+G+I 
model. ML trees showing the highest likelihood scores were indicative of better 
alignments. G-INS-i + BLOSUM62 + AA specific frequencies generated the trees 
with the best likelihood scores. 
</P>
<P>Uncertainty in our MSAs was assessed using GBlocks v0.91b (Castresana 2000). 
Ambiguous blocks were selected and removed according to the following settings: 
<UL>
 <LI>minimum number of sequences for a conserved position = 517</LI>
 <LI>minimum number of sequences for a flank position = 877</LI>
 <LI>maximum number of contiguous non-conserved positions = 8</LI>
 <LI>minimum length of a block = 10</LI>
 <LI>allowed gap positions = all</LI>
</UL>
These settings generated a conserved MSA of 1,401 sites.
