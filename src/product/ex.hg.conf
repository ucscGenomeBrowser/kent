# table from UCSC. The names should be in the form `trackDb_suffix'. This
# implies a parallel hgFindSpec format search table exists in the form

#  New browser function as of April 2007, custom track data is kept
#	in a database instead of in trash files.  This function requires
#	several other factors to be in place before it will work.
#  In this first implementation, this is an optional feature, but
#	approximately by the end of the year 2007, this will be required.
#
#	See also:
