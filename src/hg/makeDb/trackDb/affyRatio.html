<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows expression data from <A HREF="http://www.gnf.org"
TARGET=_blank">GNF</A> (The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research 
Foundation) using <A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A> GeneChips. The chip types, chip IDs or tissue 
averages associated with experiments can be displayed by selecting the 
appropriate option from the Experiment Display menu on the track 
description page. For more information, see the Track Configuration section.
</P>  

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For detailed information about the experiments, see Su <em>et al.</em> 2002 
in the References section below. Alignments displayed on the track correspond 
to the target sequences used by Affymetrix to choose probes.</P> 
<P>
In dense display mode, the track color denotes the average signal over all
experiments on a log base 2 scale. Lighter colors correspond to lower 
signals and darker colors correspond to higher signals. In full display
mode, the color of each item represents the log base 2 ratio of the signal 
of that particular experiment to the median signal of all experiments for 
that probe.</P>
<P>
More information about individual probes and probe sets is available on the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manual/probe_set_display_manual.affx" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A> website. </P>

<H2>Track Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track may be configured to change the display mode and colors or 
vary the type of experiment information shown. The configuration controls are
located at the top of the track description page, which is accessed via 
the small button to the left of the track's graphical display or the link 
on the track's control menu.

<LI><B>Display mode:</B> To change the display mode for the track, select 
the desired display setting from the Display Mode pulldown list.
<LI><B>Combine Arrays:</B> All arrays may be displayed with either the chip ID 
or the tissue type as the label.  Replicate arrays may also be combined by
expression medians.
