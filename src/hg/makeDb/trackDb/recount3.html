<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Recount3 is a comprehensive resource for re-analyzing RNA-seq data. It provides uniformly processed 
RNA-seq data and associated metadata from a wide range of studies, enabling researchers to access 
and analyze gene expression data in a consistent manner. Recount3 aggregates data from multiple 
sources, including the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, 
and reprocesses it using a standardized pipeline. This allows for cross-study comparisons and 
meta-analyses, facilitating discoveries in genomics and transcriptomics.
</p><p>
These tracks display the recount3 intron data including split read counts.
</p>


<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
Intron blocks are grayscale colored based on read support (darker tones indicate higher coverage). <br>
Split read counts and splice motifs are shown on mouseover. <br>
By default only introns with a minimum read count of 10,000 are shown. This setting can be changed
on the track configuration page. <br>
The intron ends are color coded: 
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#2E2585">Dark blue</font></b> GT donors and AG acceptors (CT and AC on 
the minus strand) </li>
<li><b><font color="#5DA899">Teal</font></b> GC donors (GT on the minus strand) </li>
<li><b><font color="#C26A77">Faded red</font></b> AT donors and AC acceptors (GT and GT on the 
minus strand) </li>
</ul>
Introns with non standard ends do not have colored tags.
<br>
The SRA track is only visible when zoomed in within 10 million bases because of its data density.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated analysis, the data may be queried from our
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>.<br>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Junction files were converted to bed format. For grayscaling total read count was log10
transformed and multiplied by 10 to get a score between 0 and 225, which can be found
in the bed score field.
