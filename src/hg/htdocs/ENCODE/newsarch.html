		    <P>
		    The ENCODE browser for UCSC human genome assembly hg18 
		    (NCBI Build 36) is now available. You can access the browser
		    directly at 
		    <A HREF="encode.hg18.html">http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg18.html</A> 
		    or by clicking the ENCODE link on the Genome Browser 
		    <A HREF="../index.html">home page</A>, then
		    selecting the Regions (hg18) item in the sidebar menu on 
		    the ENCODE portal page.</P>
		    <P>
		    The hg18 ENCODE browser includes 540 data tables in 59 
		    browser tracks that were migrated from the hg17 browser. 
		    The hg17 data coordinates were converted to hg18 coordinates
		    using the UCSC liftOver process.</P>
		    <P>
		    To improve the accessibility of the data, related ENCODE 
		    tracks have been gathered into new configuration groupings 
		    (&quot;super-tracks&quot;) that can be displayed or hidden
		    using a single visiblity control.  We have also reduced the
 		    number of track groups and have modified some of the group 
		    names for clarity. </P>

		    <P>
		    During the migration, ENCODE tracks with whole-genome 
		    data were moved into the standard browser track 
		    groups. These include the GIS PET and UCSD/LI
		    TAF1 tracks. Future submissions of whole-genome ENCODE data
 		    will be loaded directly into the standard track groups.

		    <P>
		    We have expanded the ENCODE downloads site to include 
		    original data for all &quot;wiggle&quot; datasets. These 
		    data files now have filename extensions indicating the 
		    wiggle input format (fixed step, variable step, or 
		    bedGraph).</P>

		   <P>
		    The findings of the ENCODE project have been
		    released to the public today, the culmination of a 
		    four-year effort to catalog the biologically functional 
		    elements in 1 percent of the human genome. The publications,
		    which include a group paper in the 14 June 2007 issue of 
		    <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html"
		    TARGET=_blank><em>Nature</em></A> and 28 companion papers 
		    in the June 2007 issue of 
		    <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/content/vol17/issue6/"
		    TARGET=_blank><em>Genome Research</em></A>, were authored by
		    researchers from academic, governmental, and industry
		    organizations located in 11 countries. The <em>Nature</em> 
		    issue includes a pull-out poster featuring a screenshot of 
		    the UCSC Genome Browser displaying a broad range of the 
		    ENCODE data.</P>
		    <P>
		    In the <A HREF="http://genome.gov/25521554"
		    TARGET=_blank>press release</A> accompanying the publication
		    rollout,
		    NHGRI Director Francis S. Collins is quoted as saying
		    &quot;This impressive effort has uncovered many exciting 
		    surprises and blazed the way for future efforts to explore 
		    the functional landscape of the entire human genome. Because
		    of the hard work and keen insights of the ENCODE consortium,
		    the scientific community will need to rethink some long-held
		    views about what genes are and what they do, as well as how 
	   	    the genome's functional elements have evolved. This could 
		    have significant implications for efforts to identify the 
		    DNA sequences involved in many human diseases.&quot;</P>

		    <UL>
		    <LI>
		    The human assembly version remains at hg16 (Jul. 2003).
		    <LI>
		    The mouse assembly has been updated from mm5 (May 2004) to
		    mm6 (Mar. 2005).
		    <LI>
		    The multiple rat sequences have been replaced by a single
		    sequence: rn3 (Jun. 2003).
		    <LI>
		    The cow sequences have been updated using an assembly of 
		    BAC-based sequences provided by Baylor College of 
		    Medicine.
		    <LI>
		    Fugu (fr1), macaque (rheMac1), opossum (monDom1), 
		    Tetraodon (tetNig1), Xenopus (xenTro1), and zebrafish 
		    (danRer2) have been added.  The macaque sequence was 
		    obtained from a Baylor 
		    College of Medicine assembly that has not yet been 
		    officially released. 
		    <LI>
		    A new NISC species, rfbat 
		    (<em>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</em>), is now available.
		    <LI>
		    Platypus data from regions 
		    where NISC has not yet generated data were provided by 
		    Jim Mullikin from a preliminary assembly of Washington 
		    University WGS reads. 
		    <LI>
		    This freeze includes low-redundancy sequence data from 
		    tenrec, elephant, armadillo, and rabbit. Only one set of 
		    sequences are provided per species/target combination; 
		    where available, NISC data is provided instead of 
		    the 2X assemblies. These data are not yet accessioned at 
		    NCBI, but were made available by the Broad Institute 
		    (rabbit, elephant, armadillo) and Jim Mullikin (tenrec).
		    <LI>
		    Orthology predictions for Fugu were made only by 
		    MAVID/Mercator; predictions for all other assemblies 
		    supported by the UCSC Genome Browser represent a union 
		    with UCSC predictions as well. Because no additional 
		    post-processing was done on the Fugu predictions, they 
		    contain a few very small contigs.

		    <P>
		    The First Exon/BU annotation track, contributed by the
		    <A HREF="http://zlab.bu.edu/zlab/index.shtml"
		    TARGET=_blank>ZLAB</A> at Boston University, is now 
		    available in the UCSC Genome Browser. This track displays 
		    expression levels of computationally identified first 
		    exons and a constitutive exon of 20 genes in the ENCODE 
		    regions.</P>
		    <P>
		    For each gene, all alternative first exons were identified
		    based on manual selection of predictions from the 
		    <A HREF="http://biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/Promoser/"
		    TARGET=_blank>PromoSer</A>
		    program. The expression levels of exons were then 
		    quantified using rcPCR in ten normal human tissues.</P>
		    <P>
		    Thanks to Ulas Karaoz and the Zhiping Weng lab at 
		    Boston University for providing these data. For more
		    information about this annotation, as well as a complete
		    list of the individuals who contributed to this track,

<PRE>
    ChIp/LI Pol2
    ChIp/LI TAF1
</PRE>
                    To facilitate data analysis, the data were also reloaded
                    in a format that allows extraction of the original data

		    <P>
		    A second set of ENCODE ChIp/Chip data is now available on

<PRE>
    ChIp/Affy Pol2 Pval
    ChIp/Affy Pol2 Sites
    RNA/Affy Signal
    RNA/Affy Sites
</PRE>
		    These tracks show RNA Polymerase II precipitation and 
		    RNA abundance in retinoic acid-stimulated HL-60 cells at 
		    0, 2, 8, and 32 hours, as measured by Affymetrix tiling 
		    arrays in the non-repetitive ENCODE regions.  The 
		    <em>Pval</em> and <em>Signal</em> tracks show values 
		    for each tiled probe; the <em>Sites</em> tracks show 
		    contiguous regions of enrichment.
		    <P>
		    A new <em>composite</em> track display was developed to 
		    concisely display multiple data sets of similar types, a 
		    common feature of ENCODE data.  Each of these new tracks 
		    contains 4 subtracks, one for each time interval.  The 
		    subtracks share a single description page and set of 
		    visibility controls.  Checkboxes on the track 
		    configuration page allow selected subtracks to be hidden 
		    in the display.

  	      <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#006666">Posted on 26 Oct. 2004 - Sequence Freeze For Multiple Alignments</FONT><BR>
		    <P>
		    We are pleased to release the first "official" sequence 
		    data freeze for the ENCODE multiple sequence alignment 
		    projects. The data formats are described in the 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/OCT-2004/README.txt" 
		    TARGET=_blank>README</A> file, and the sequences and 
		    supporting information is collected in the 
		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/OCT-2004" 
		    TARGET=_blank> data directory</A>.
		    <P>
		    The species included in this freeze are as follows:
<PRE>
       _SPECIES_      _SOURCE_
        Human           hg16
        Chimpanzee      panTro1
        Dog             canFam1
        Rat             rn3
        RatB	        BCM
        Mouse           mm5
        Chicken		galGal2
        Galago		NISC
        Baboon		NISC
        Marmoset        NISC
        Armadillo       NISC
        Platypus        NISC
</PRE>
		    You will notice that we have worked hard to include a 
		    number of species for which genome-wide sequence data was 
		    already available. The process by which these orthologous 
		    regions were identified is still an area of active 
		    research development, the details of which will be 
		    presented at the upcoming ENCODE meeting at CSHL.
		    <P>
		    Please note that we have also included a *second* rat 
		    sequence (ratB) in this freeze.  RatB represents an 
		    initiative to standardize the quality level of sequences 
		    in the ENCODE regions for species with genome-wide 
		    sequence data. The data were made available just before 
		    our freeze date, so we decided to include both versions of
		    the rat sequence for now. Eventually these sequences will 
		    likely be rolled into future genome assemblies.
		    <P>
		    Remember, this is a work in progress, so not all targets 
		    have sequence from all species. And some species/target 
		    combinations may not be complete yet. Progress on the 
		    NISC-generated sequences can be found at the 
		    <A HREF="http://www.nisc.nih.gov/open_page.cgi?path=/projects/encode/index.cgi"
		    TARGET=_blank> NISC ENCODE Project: Comparative 
		    Sequencing</A>.
		    <P>
		    Many people have worked very hard to make these data 
		    available. Special thanks to Daryl Thomas, Kate 
		    Rosenbloom and the entire UCSC Team; Greg Schuler and the 
		    NCBI team; Colin Dewey and Lior Pachter; Pam Thomas and 
		    the NISC team; and David Wheeler and the BCM team.
