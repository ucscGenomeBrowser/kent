<P>
This track contains information about a subset of the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 134, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>.
Only SNPs that have a minor allele frequency of at least 1% and
are mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly are
included in this subset.  Frequency data are not available for all SNPs,
so this subset is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
The selection of SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 1% or greater
is an attempt to identify variants that appear to be reasonably common
in the general population.  Taken as a set, common variants should be
less likely to be associated with severe genetic diseases due to the
effects of natural selection,
following the view that deleterious variants are not likely to become
common in the population.
However, the significance of any particular variant should be interpreted
only by a trained medical geneticist using all available information.
