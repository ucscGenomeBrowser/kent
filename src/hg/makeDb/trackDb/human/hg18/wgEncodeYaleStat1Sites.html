<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Target protein STAT1
(<A HREF="http://www.scbt.com/product.php?datasheet=345" TARGET=_blank>Santa Cruz SC-345</A>)
was purified by chromatin immunoprecipitation from
<A HREF="https://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=CCL-2.2&Template=cellBiology" TARGET=_blank>HeLaS3</A>
(cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma) cells. The series is comprised of three
biological replicates, done using ChIP-Sequencing on a Solexa machine.
DNA fragments are selected for sizes in the range of 100-300 bps, then 27nts
tags are sequenced from the ends of these fragments.
</P>
<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The sequenced tags are mapped onto the hg18 build of the human genome using the
Eland application (Illumina).  Only tags that map uniquely with at most
two mismatches are included. 6,540,633 tags were mapped uniquely to the genome 
from the combined data from the three biological replicates.
</P>
82,440 STAT1 binding sites were determined using a peak threshold of 7 
overlapping mapped fragments which corresponds to an expected false discovery 
rate of less than 0.1% as estimated by computer simulation.
