<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows the finished assembly of the $organism genome.
This assembly merges contigs from overlapping drafts and
finished clones into longer sequence contigs.  The sequence
contigs are ordered and oriented when possible by mRNA, EST,
paired plasmid reads (from the SNP Consortium) and BAC end
sequence pairs.</P>
<P>In dense mode, this track depicts the path through the draft and 
finished clones (aka the golden path) used to create the assembled sequence. 
Clone boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist in the path, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  If the relative order and orientation of the contigs
between the two blocks is known, a line is drawn to bridge the
blocks.</P>

Clone Type Key:
<UL>
<LI><B>F</B> - Finished (HTGS phase 3)
<LI><B>O</B> - Other sequence (typically means no HTG keyword)
<LI><B>P</B> - Pre draft
<LI><B>W</B> - WGS contig
</UL>
