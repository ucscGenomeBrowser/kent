<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows regions detected as putative genomic duplications within the
golden path. The following display conventions are used to distinguish
levels of similarity:
<UL>
<LI>
Light to dark gray: 90 - 98% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark yellow: 98 - 99% similarity
<LI>
Light to dark orange: greater than 99% similarity 
<LI>
Red: duplications of greater than 98% similarity that lack sufficient 
Segmental Duplication Database evidence (most likely missed overlaps) 
</UL>
For a region to be included in the track, at least 500 bp of the total 
sequence (containing at least 100 bp of non-RepeatMasked sequence) had to 
align and a sequence identity of at least 90% was required.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For a description of the 'fuguization' detection method, see Bailey, J.A. 
<em>et. al</em>. (2001) in the References section below.
