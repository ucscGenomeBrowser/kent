<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This container track contains annotation tracks with variant frequencies, aka
allele frequencies, from these projects:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b><a href="https://www.mxbiobank.org/" target=_blank>Mexico Biobank (MXB)</a></b>: This track displays 
            alleles and their haplotypes from the Mexico Biobank
      (MXB), based on array genotyping of 6,011 individuals sampled across all 32 states of Mexico during
      the 2000 National Health Survey (ENSA 2000) conducted by the National Institute of Public Health (INSP). 
      Frequencies can be plotted onto a map on <a href="https://morenolab.shinyapps.io/mexvar/" target=_blank>MexVar</a>.

    <li>
        <b><a href="https://rgc-mcps.regeneron.com/home" target=_blank>Mexico City Prospective Study (MCPS)</a></b>: 
        9,950 whole genome sequenced individuals
      and 141,046 exome sequenced and genotyped individuals from the Mexico
  City Prospective Study (MCPS), a collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics
  Center, University of Oxford, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM),
  National Institute of Genomic Medicine in Mexico, Abbvie Inc. and AstraZeneca
  UK. For details see (Ziyatdinov A, Nature 2023), the reference section.

        <b><a href="https://rgc-research.regeneron.com/me/home"
                target=_blank>Regeneron Million Exomes Project (ME)</a></b>:
        Whole-exomes of
        983,578 individuals sequenced by the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC).
    These data span dozens of collaborations including large biobanks and
    health systems. All data were generated by the RGC on a single, harmonized
sequencing and informatics protocol. The dataset includes individuals across
diverse ancestral populations, encompassing outbred and founder populations and
cohorts with high rates of consanguinity. See (Sun et al, Nature 2024) for details. </li>
    <li>
        <b><a href="https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/" target=_blank>NHLBI TOPMED
                Freeze 10</a></b>: NHLBI TOPMed (Trans-Omics for Precision
        Medicine) program, launched by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood
        Institute, integrates whole-genome sequencing with molecular, clinical,
    and environmental data from large, well-phenotyped cohorts. Its goal is to
    uncover the biological mechanisms underlying heart, lung, blood, and sleep
disorders to advance precision medicine and improve population health. Freeze
10 contains 868,581,653 variants from 150,899 whole genomes. VCFs were
downloaded from <a href="https://bravo.sph.umich.edu/terms.html"
                   target=_blank>BRAVO</a>.  </li>
    <li>
      <b>GenomeAsia Pilot (GAsP) </b>: Whole-genome sequencing data of 1,739
      individuals from 219 population groups across Asia. See (GenomeAsia
      Consortium, Nature 2019) for details.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>

<p>Most tracks only show the variant and allele frequencies on mouseover or clicks.
When zoomed in, tracks display alleles with base-specific coloring. Homozygote
data are shown as one letter, while heterozygotes will be displayed with both
letters.
</p>

<p>
For the MXB track: In "pack" mode, this track sorts the haplotypes. This can be
useful for determining the similarity between the samples and inferring
inheritance at a particular locus.
For a full description of how the display works, please see our 
<a href="../goldenpath/help/hgVcfTrackHelp.html">Haplotype Display help page</a>.
Briefly, each sample's phased and/or homozygous genotypes are split into haplotypes,
clustered by similarity around a central variant (in pink), and sorted for
display by their position in the clustering tree. Click a variant to center on it.
The tree (as space allows) is drawn in the label area next to the track image.
Leaf clusters, in which all haplotypes are identical (at least for the variants
used in clustering), are colored purple. 
</p>


<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>Most of the data in these tracks are not available for download from UCSC.
Only individual variants can be browsed on our website.
But the data can be downloaded
for free from the original projects. Accessing the 
data usually requires a click-through license on the respectice websites:

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
MXB: Genotyping was performed with the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Global Array
(MEGA, ~1.8M SNPs), optimized for admixed populations and enriched for
ancestry-informative and medically relevant variants. Only autosomal, biallelic
SNPs passing quality control are included. Samples were selected from 898
recruitment sites, with prioritization of indigenous language speakers. Data
processing included GenomeStudio &rarr; PLINK conversion, strand alignment, removal
of duplicates, update of map positions using dbSNP Build 151 and low-quality
variants/individuals, and relatedness filtering.

generating and providing the frequency data, the National Institute of Medical
Sciences and Nutrition (INCMNSZ) for DNA extraction, and the Ministry of Health
