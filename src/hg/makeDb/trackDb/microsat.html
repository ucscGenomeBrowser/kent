<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays regions that are likely to be useful as microsatellite
markers. These are sequences of at least 15 perfect di-nucleotide and 
tri-nucleotide repeats and tend to be highly polymorphic in the
population.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The data shown in this track are a subset of the Simple Repeats track, 
selecting only those 
repeats of period 2 and 3, with 100% identity and no indels and with
at least 15 copies of the repeat.  The Simple Repeats track is
created using the <A HREF="http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.submit.options.html" TARGET=_blank>
Tandem Repeats Finder</A>.  For more information about this 
program, see Benson (1999).</P>
