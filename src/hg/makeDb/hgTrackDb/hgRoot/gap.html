<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a 'bridged' gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. There are four principle types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI>Fragment - gaps between the contigs of a draft clone. These are represented
by 100 N's in the assembly, whether or not there is bridging information.
<LI>Clone - gaps between clones in the same map contig.  These are represented
by 50,000 N's in the assembly if the gap is bridged or 100,000 N's if it is not.
<LI>Contig - gaps between map contigs. These are represented by 200,000 N's in the assembly.
<LI>Heterochromatin - gaps from centromeres (3,000,000 N's) or other large blocks of heterochromatin (size varies).
