<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The <b>${longLabel}</b> track shows a score that tries to identify missense-depleted
regions using the patterns of rare missense variation in 125,748 gnomAD v2.1.1 exomes,
compared to a null mutational model. Missense-depleted regions are enriched for ClinVar pathogenic
variants, de novo missense variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), and
complex trait heritability. The score's publication suggests that regions
with less than 20% of their expected missense variation achieve moderate
support for pathogenicity according to ACMG criteria.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Transcripts with constraint predictions are highlighted. Observed and expected
number of missense mutations are shown on mouse overs, as well as their
Observed/expected ratio (OE), and the Chi-square and P-value of the ratio.
Regions are colored using the viridis palette, with yellow for the lowest OE
values and dark blue for the highest values.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
The study analyzed only canonical, coding transcripts as defined by GENCODE v19/Ensembl v74. Some
were excluded: transcripts that had outlier counts of variants expected under neutrality (zero
expected pLoF, missense, or synonymous variants; too many observed pLoF, missense, or synonymous
variants compared to expectation; or too few observed synonymous variants compared to expectation).
In total, the study analyzed 18,629 transcripts.
</p>

</p>125,748 gnomAD v2.1.1 exomes were used on hg19.
Median coverage was calculated on a random subset of the gnomAD exomes.
The set of sites with possible missense variants was described using a
synthetic Hail Table (HT) containing all possible single nucleotide variants in the exome. 
Ensembl VEP annotated this HT against GENCODE version 19, and filtered to
variants with the consequence "missense_variant" in the canonical, coding
transcripts as defined above. Variants were filtered by
following criteria: (1) allele count (AC) &gt; 0 and AF &lt; 0.001, variant QC PASS, and median3
coverage &gt; 0 in gnomAD v2.1.1 exomes; or (2) AC = 0, i.e. variants not seen in gnomAD v2.1.1
exomes.
</p>

<p>
A likelihood ratio test was applied to assess whether the missense observed/expected (OE) ratio
was uniform along each transcript or if distinct regions of missense constraint were present.
Observed and expected missense counts were modeled using a Poisson distribution, with the null
hypothesis assuming no regional variability in missense depletion and the alternative allowing for
subsections with differing OE ratios. Chi-square statistics (p = 0.001) were used to identify
significant breakpoints dividing transcripts into two or more sections, requiring at least 16
expected missense variants per subsection. Transcripts lacking a single significant breakpoint were
further analyzed for two simultaneous breakpoints, with all significant results merged across
search types. Recursive testing was then performed, treating each identified subsection as an
independent transcript until no additional significant breakpoints were detected. To focus on
missense depletion, subsections with observed counts exceeding expectations were capped at an OE
of 1, and subsections with zero expected variants were assigned an expected count of 10<sup>-9</sup>
to avoid nonfinite OE values.
