<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track shows locations of Sequence Tagged Sites (STS) 
along the rat draft assembly.  These markers have been mapped using 
either genetic (Rat FHH x ACI F2 Intercross Genetic Map, Rat SHRSP x BN F2 Intercross Genetic Map)
or radiation hybridization (RH Map 2.2) mapping techniques.</P>
<P>
Additional data on the individual maps can be found at the following links:
<UL>
<LI>NCBI UniSTS (now part of NCBI <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/probe" target="_blank">Probe</a>)
<LI><A href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/" TARGET=_blank> Rat Genome Database</A>
</UL><P>

<P>By default all genetic map markers are shown as blue; only radiation
hybrid markers and markers that are neither genetic nor radiation hybrid
are shown as black; markers that map to more than one position are
shown in lighter colors. Users  can choose a color to highlight a subset
of markers of interest from the Filter options in STS Markers
Track Setting page.

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude
a set of map data within the track. This is helpful when many items
are shown in the track display, especially when only some are relevant
to the current task. To use the filter:
<UL>
<LI>In the pulldown menu, select the map whose data you would like to
highlight or exclude in the display. By default, the &quot;All
Genetic&quot; option is selected.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that will be used to
highlight or include/exclude the filtered items. If
&quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not display data from
the map selected in the pulldown list. If &quot;include&quot; is
selected, the browser will display only data from the selected map.
</UL></P>
<P>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the
<em>Submit</em> button.</P>
