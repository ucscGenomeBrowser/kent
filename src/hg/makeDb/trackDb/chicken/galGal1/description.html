The January 2004 chicken (<em>Gallus gallus</em>) draft assembly 
was produced by the Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium. 

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic clone, an mRNA or EST or STS marker, or
a cytological band, a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list shows 
examples of valid position queries for the chicken genome.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
The sequence covers about ?? percent of the genome,
and has been sequenced to 6.63X coverage.
Approximately 88% of the sequence has been anchored to a chromosome; 
the remaining contigs have been concatenated into the virtual chromosome 
&quot;chrUn&quot; separated by gaps of 10,000 bp.  The chicken mitochondrial 
sequence is also available as the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;.

Bulk downloads of the sequence and annotation data are available via 
the Genome Browser <A HREF="ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/galGal1/">FTP
server</A> or the <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads#chicken">Downloads</A> page. 
The chicken browser annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and 
collaborators worldwide. See the
