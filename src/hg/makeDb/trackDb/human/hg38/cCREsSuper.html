<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track contains cCREs (candidate Cis-Regulatory Elements) data from ENCODE3 and ENCODE4.
Below is a short summary of each track.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ENCODE4 cCREs</b>: ENCODE4 data containing the cCREs identified and classified from all
ENCODE4 samples. The data were combined, so this track is a representation of all
the underlying data in one track.</li>
<li><b>ENCODE4 Core Collection</b>: ENCODE4 data containing additional subtracks of the 
underlying signals used to create
the ENCODE4 cCREs track above. The track also contains cCREs tracks that are sample-specific.</li>
<li><b>ENCODE3 cCREs</b>: This track is similar to the ENCODE4 cCREs, but created from the ENCODE3
data. ENCODE4 includes the ENCODE3 data, so ENCODE4 should be used whenever possible. This track
exists for archival and reproducibility purposes.</li>
