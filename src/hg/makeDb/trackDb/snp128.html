<H2>Interpreting and Configuring the Graphical Display</H2>
<P>
  Variants are shown as single tick marks at most zoom levels.
  When viewing the track at or near base-level resolution, the displayed
  width of the SNP corresponds to the width of the variant in the reference
  sequence. Insertions are indicated by a single tick mark displayed between
  two nucleotides, single nucleotide polymorphisms are displayed as the width 
  of a single base, and multiple nucleotide variants are represented by a 
  block that spans two or more bases.
</P>

<P>
  The configuration categories reflect the following definitions (not all categories apply
  to this assembly):

  </UL>
</P>

<H2>Insertions/Deletions</H2>
<P>
dbSNP uses a class called 'in-del'.  We compare the length of the
reference allele to the length(s) of observed alleles; if the
reference allele is shorter than all other observed alleles, we change
'in-del' to 'insertion'.  Likewise, if the reference allele is longer
than all other observed alleles, we change 'in-del' to 'deletion'.
</P>

<H2>UCSC Annotations</H2>
<P>
UCSC checks for several unusual conditions that may indicate a problem 
with the mapping, and reports them in the Annotations section if found:
  <UL>
  <LI>The dbSNP reference allele is not the same as the UCSC reference
      allele, i.e. the bases in the mapped position range.</LI>
  <LI>Class is single, in-del, mnp or mixed and the UCSC reference
      allele does not match any observed allele.</LI>
  <LI>In NCBI's alignment of flanking sequences to the genome, part
      of the flanking sequence around the SNP does not align to
      the genome.</LI>
  <LI>Class is single, but the size of the mapped SNP is not one base.</LI>
  <LI>Class is named and indicates an insertion or deletion, but the size
      of the mapped SNP implies otherwise.</LI>
  <LI>Class is single and the format of observed alleles is unexpected.</LI>
  <LI>The length of the observed allele(s) is not available because it is
      too long.</LI>
  <LI>Multiple distinct insertion SNPs have been mapped to this location.</LI>
  <LI>At least one observed allele contains an ambiguous IUPAC base 
      (e.g. R, Y, N).</LI>
  </UL>

Another condition, which does not necessarily imply any problem, is noted:
  <UL>
  <LI>Class is single and SNP is tri-allelic or quad-allelic.</LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<H2>UCSC Re-alignment of flanking sequences</H2>
<P>
dbSNP determines the genomic locations of SNPs by aligning their flanking 
sequences to the genome.
UCSC does not have dbSNP's alignments, but re-aligns the flanking sequences 
to the neighboring genomic sequence for display on SNP details pages.  
While the recomputed alignments may differ from the alignments upon which 
dbSNP bases its annotations, they often are informative when UCSC has 
annotated an unusual condition.
</P>

<H2>Data Sources</H2>
<P>
The data that comprise this track were extracted from database dump files 
and headers of fasta files downloaded from NCBI.  
The database dump files were downloaded from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/"
TARGET=_BLANK>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/</A>
<EM>organism</EM>_<EM>tax_id</EM>/database/
(e.g. for Human, <EM>organism</EM>_<EM>tax_id</EM> = human_9606).
The fasta files were downloaded from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/"
TARGET=_BLANK>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/</A>
<EM>organism</EM>_<EM>tax_id</EM>/rs_fasta/
  <UL>
  <LI>Coordinates, orientation, location type and dbSNP reference allele data
      were obtained from b128_SNPContigLoc_36_2.bcp.gz and 
      b128_SNPContigInfo_36_2.bcp.gz.  
  <LI>b128_SNPMapInfo_36_2.bcp.gz provided the alignment weights.
  <LI>Functional classification was obtained from 
      b128_SNPContigLocusId_36_2.bcp.gz.
  <LI>Validation status and heterozygosity were obtained from SNP.bcp.gz.
  <LI>The header lines in the rs_fasta files were used for molecule type,
      class and observed polymorphism.
  </UL>
</P>

<H2>Orthologous Alleles (human only)</H2>
<P>
Beginning with the March 2006 human assembly, we provide a related table that 
contains orthologous alleles in the chimpanzee and rhesus macaque assemblies.
We use our liftOver utility to identify the orthologous alleles.  The candidate human SNPs are 
a filtered list that meet the criteria:
<UL>
<LI>class = 'single'
<LI>chromEnd = chromStart + 1
<LI>align to just one location
<LI>are not aligned to a chrN_random chrom
<LI>are biallelic (not tri or quad allelic)
</UL>

In some cases the orthologous allele is unknown; these are set to 'N'.
If a lift was not possible, we set the orthologous allele to '?' and the orthologous start and end 
position to 0 (zero).

<H2>Masked FASTA Files (human only)</H2>

FASTA files that have been modified to use IUPAC ambiguous nucleotide characters at
each base covered by a single-base substitution are available for download
<A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/snp128Mask/">here</A>.
Note that only single-base substitutions (no insertions or deletions) were used
to mask the sequence, and these were filtered to exlcude problematic SNPs.
