<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows clusters of DNaseI hypersensitivity derived from assays in 95 cell types
by the
<a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/stamj.htm" target="_blank">John Stamatoyannapoulos lab</a>
at the University of Washington from September 2007 to January 2011, as part of the
<a target="_blank" href="../ENCODE">ENCODE project first production phase</a>.
Regulatory regions in general, and promoters in particular, tend to be DNase-sensitive.  
</p>

<p>
Additional views of this data sites are displayed from the
<a target="_blank" href=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase>DNaseI HS</a> track.
The peaks in that track are the basis for the clusters shown here,  
which combine data from peaks from the different cell lines.
Please note that track colors for the DNase tracks are based on similiarity of cell types,
while there is different coloring for cell types on the ENCODE hg38
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegTxn">Transcription</a> track,
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k4me1">Layered H3K4Me1</a> track,
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k4me3">Layered H3K4Me3</a> track, and
<a target=_blank href="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegMarkH3k27ac">Layered H3K27Ac</a> track,
which match the coloring used in their previous versions lifted from the hg19 assembly.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
A gray box indicates the extent of the hypersensitive region.  
The darkness is proportional to the maximum signal strength observed in any cell line.  
The number to the left of the box shows how many cell lines are hypersensitive in the region.  
The track can be configured to restrict the display to elements above a specified score 
in the range 1-1000 (where score is based on signal strength).
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Raw sequence data files were processed by the UCSC ENCODE DNase analysis pipeline (July 2014
specification), diagrammed here:

</div>

<p>
Briefly, sequence files were aligned to the hg38 (GRCh38) genome assembly augmented with 'sponge'
sequence (ref).  Multi-mapped reads were removed, as were reads that aligned to 'sponge' or
mitochondiral sequence.  Results from all replicates were pooled, and further processed by
the Hotspot program to call peaks.
</p>

<p>
Peaks of DNaseI hypersensitivity from the ENCODE DNase Analysis Pipeline at UCSC
were assigned normalized scores (by UCSC regClusterMakeTableOfTables) in the range 0-1000 based
on the 
<a target="_blank" href="../FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12">narrowPeak</a>
signalValue and then clustered on score (by UCSC regCluster) to generate singly-linked clusters.  
Additional documentation on the methods used to identify hypersensitive sites are 
available from the
<a target="_blank" href=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeRegDnase>DNaseI HS</a> track.
