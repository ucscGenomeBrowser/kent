genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified physician for
diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.  Further, please be

<P>OMIM is a compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes. The full-text,
referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known Mendelian
disorders and over 12,000 genes. OMIM is authored and edited at the
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, under the direction of Dr. Ada Hamosh.  This database
was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog
of Mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance
in Man (MIM).

<P>
The OMIM data are separated into three separate tracks:
</P>

<P><B>OMIM Allelic Variant SNPs</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variants in the OMIM database that have associated 
dbSNP identifiers.

<P><B>OMIM Genes</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genomic positions of gene entries in the OMIM 
database.  The coloring indicates the associated OMIM phenotype map key.
</P>

<P><B>OMIM Phenotypes - Gene Unknown</B>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regions known to be associated with a phenotype, 
but for which no specific gene is known to be causative. This track 
also includes known multi-gene syndromes.
