<H2>Nucleosome Position Data</H2>

<H2>Description</H2>

<P>Nucleosomes, each consisting of a heterooctamer of histones 2A, 2B, 3, and 4, effect the first level of chromatin packaging by their ability to wrap naked DNA 1.6 times around themselves.  The length of wrapped DNA, the so-called &quot;core&quot; fragment, is 147 base pairs long.  Neighboring nucleosomes are separated from one another by the so-called &quot;linker&quot;, whose size varies depending on organism, cell type, and even chromatin activity.  Certain chromatin remodeling factors govern accessibility of regulatory proteins to DNA by moving around nucleosomes to reveal regulatory sites that would otherwise be occluded by a nucleosome.
</P>

<P>In contrast to histone modifications such as methylation or acetylation, which are investigated by ChIP-seq, nucleosome positioning data are generated without immunoprecipitation (see Methods below).  Instead, micrococcal nuclease is used to digest chromatin to apparent completion, the (well-defined and clearly visible) mononucleosomal core fragment fraction is isolated by gel purification, and one end is then sequenced. Mapping the sequence tag back to the genome reveals the precise position of one end of the core fragment that was protected by the nucleosome;  the position of the other end can then simply be inferred by extending the read to a virtual length of 147 bases. Statistical analyses such as occupancy and positioning stringency can then be employed to analyze the local nucleosome landscape anywhere in the (mappable) genome or to infer global parameters of nucleosome organization.
</P>

<P>In the context of the ENCODE project, nucleosome positioning data are particularly valuable for analysis of the relationship between transcription factor binding, histone modifications, and gene activity.

<P>For a general primer on these types of data and analyses, refer to Valouev et al. (2008).

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
K562 and GM12878 were each grown to &#126;2.5&times;10&#94;8 cells.  The cells were harvested, frozen and 
the nucleosome core isolation followed (Valouev et al. 2008).
</P>

<P>The SOLiD reads were mapped in color-space with the probabilistic mapper,
<A HREF="https://dnanexus.com">DNAnexus</A>. The DNAnexus mapper measures and propagates mapping uncertainty by including both quality values and mismatches in the alignment score calculation. The scores are then scaled across all possible mappings of the read to estimate the posterior probability for alignment to each genomic location. Reads corresponding to posterior probability of correct mapping &gt; 0.9 were reported. 
</P>

<P>Nucleosome density signal maps (bedgraph and bigwig files) were generated by 
first shifting reads by 74 bp in the 5&acute; to 3&acute; direction and counting 
the total number of reads starting at each genomic coordinate on both strands. 
These counts are then smoothed using un-normalized kernel density smoothing 
with a triweight kernel. A bandwidth of 30 bp is used which is equivalent to 
a smoothing window of 60 bp. The smoothed counts at each position are then 
divided by the expected number of reads from an equivalent uniform distribution 
of reads in a &plusmn; 30 bp window around that position. If less than 25&#37; 
of the positions in a &plusmn; 30 bp window around a genomic location are 
uniquely mappable or if the location is part of an assembly gap, the signal 
value at that position is considered unreliable and not recorded in the signal 
files. Hence, genomic coordinates that do not have any associated signal value 
should be considered missing or unreliable data. Genomic coordinates associated 
with a signal value of 0 are reliably mapable but do not have any signal in the dataset.
