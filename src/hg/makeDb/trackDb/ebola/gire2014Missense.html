<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track displays protein changing variants identified in 81 samples from the Zaire clade of Ebola viruses found by Gire <em>et al</em>., 2014.
</p>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<p>
In &quot;dense&quot; mode, a vertical line is drawn at the position of each variant.
In &quot;full&quot; mode, in addition to the vertical line, a label to
the left shows the reference allele first and variant alleles below
(<span style='color:red;'>A = red</span>, <span style='color:blue;'>C = blue</span>,
<span style='color:green;'>G = green</span>, <span style='color:magenta;'>T = magenta</span>,
Indels = black).
Hovering the pointer over any variant will prompt the display of the occurrences numbers for each
allele in Gire <em>et al</em>., 2014.  Clicking on any variant will result in
full details of that variant being displayed.</p>
<p>
By default, in &quot;pack&quot; mode, the
display shows a clustering of haplotypes in the viewed range, sorted
by similarity of alleles weighted by proximity to a central variant.
The clustering view can highlight local patterns of linkage.</p>
<p>
Each variant is a vertical bar with black representing the reference allele
and white (invisible) representing the non-reference allele(s).
Tick marks are drawn at the top and bottom of each variant's vertical bar
to make the bar more visible when most alleles are reference alleles.
The vertical bar for the central variant used in clustering is outlined in purple.
In order to avoid long compute times, the range of alleles used in clustering
may be limited; alleles used in clustering have purple tick marks at the
top and bottom.</p>
<p> 
The clustering tree is displayed to the left of the main image.
It does not represent relatedness of individuals; it simply shows the arrangement
of local haplotypes by similarity.  When a rightmost branch is purple, it means
that all haplotypes in that branch are identical, at least within the range of
variants used in clustering.
