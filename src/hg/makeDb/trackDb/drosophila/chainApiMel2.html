<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of <em>$o_Organism</em> ($o_db, $o_date) to the
<em>$organism</em> genome using a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps 
than traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also tolerate gaps in both
<em>$o_Organism</em> and <em>$Organism</em> simultaneously. These 
&quot;double-sided&quot; gaps can be caused by local inversions and 
overlapping deletions in both species.</P>
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
<em>$o_Organism</em> assembly or an insertion in the <em>$Organism</em> 
assembly.  Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of
the <em>$Organism</em> genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often 
due to processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more 
often due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes.</P> 
<P>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</P>
<P>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
<P>
The <em>$o_Organism</em>/<em>$Organism</em> genomes were aligned with 
blastz and converted into axt format using the lavToAxt program.
The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all 
alignments between a single <em>$o_organism</em> chromosome and a single 
<em>$Organism</em> chromosome into a group and creates a kd-tree out 
of the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program 
was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these 
blocks. $matrix Chains scoring below a threshold were discarded; the remaining 
chains are displayed in this track.</P>

The axtChain program was developed at the University of California at 
Santa Cruz by Jim Kent with advice from Webb Miller and David Haussler.</P>
