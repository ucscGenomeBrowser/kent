<P>
Mononucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads: shows the spans of 147 bp
nucleosomal fragments based on the positions of SOLiD cores aligned to
the sense strand of the reference C. elegans genome. The thick portion of the
green band represents the actual 20 bp of reads that were aligned.

<P>
Mononucleosomal fragments, antisense strand reads: shows the spans of 147 bp
nucleosomal fragments based on the position of SOLiD cores aligned to the
antisense strand of the reference C. elegans genome. The thick portion of the
blue band represents the actual 20 bp of reads that were aligned.

<P>
Sheared genomic DNA displayed as mononucleosomal fragments, sense strand reads:
shows random 20 nt sequence reads from sheared C. elegans genomic DNA that
align with the sense strand of the reference genome.  For comparison to the
nucleosomal reads, these are displayed in the same way as nucleosomal
fragments. This track provides a measure of "sequenceability" across the
genome.
