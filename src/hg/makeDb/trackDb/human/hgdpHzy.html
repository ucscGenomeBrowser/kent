<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows a 3-SNP moving average of 
<em>p(1-p)</em> where <em>p</em> is the major allele frequency
(i.e. half of the expected heterozygosity) 
on seven continents,
from SNPs genotyped in 53 populations worldwide by the 
<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/group/morrinst/hgdp.html" TARGET=_BLANK>Human 
Genome Diversity Project</A> in collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://www.cephb.fr/en/cephdb/" TARGET=_BLANK>Centre d'Etude 
du Polymorphisme Humain</A> (HGDP-CEPH).
This track and several others are available from the 
<A HREF="http://hgdp.uchicago.edu/" TARGET=_BLANK>HGDP Selection Browser</A>.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Samples collected by the HGDP-CEPH from 1,043 individuals from around the
world were genotyped for 657,000 SNPs at
<A HREF="http://hagsc.org/hgdp/" TARGET=_BLANK>Stanford</A>.
The 53 populations were divided into seven continental groups: Africa,
Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
Allele frequencies were used to calculate <em>p(1-p)</em> 
for each SNP, and then a
3-SNP average was computed for each SNP and its two neighboring SNPs.</P>

<P>
The associated analysis tracks HGDP FST, HGP iHS, and HGDP XP-EHH
(Pickrell <em>et al.</em>) did not make use of all African populations, but
instead used only the Bantu populations because a more closely related
group was desired for comparison with other continental groups.
For this track, separate subtracks show the expected heterozygosity 
of all African populations and of only Bantu populations.
