<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays transcriptome data from tiling GeneChips produced by 
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com" TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix</A>. For the ten
chromosomes 6, 7, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, X, and Y, more than 74 million
probes were tiled every 5 bp in non-repeat-masked areas 
and hybridized to mRNA from the SK-N-AS cell line. These data
are a preview of Phase Two of the transcriptome project, which will
include data from seven additional cell lines when completed. While the
coverage of the genome is much larger and the probe density greater,
the general method is similar to the Phase One project carried out on
chromosomes 21 and 22  (Kapranov, P. <em>et al</em>.

The track is colored blue in areas that are thought to be
transcribed at a statistically significant level as described in the
accompanying <a
href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=affyTransfrags">Transfrags</a>
(transcribed fragments) track. Transfrags that have a
significant blat hit elsewhere in the genome are displayed in a lighter
shade of blue, and transfrags that overlap putative pseudogenes are
colored an even lighter shade of blue. All other regions of the track
are colored brown. While the raw data are based on prefect match minus
mismatch probe (PM - MM) values and may contain negative values, the
track has a minimum value of 0 for visualization purposes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For each data point, probes within 30 bp on either side were used to
improve the estimate of expression level for a particular probe. This
helps to smooth the data and produce a more robust estimate of the
transcription level at a particular genomic location. The following
analysis method was used:
<UL>
<LI>Replicate arrays were quantile-normalized and the median
intensity (using both PM and MM intensities) of each array was
scaled to a target value of 44.
<LI>The expression level was estimated for each mapped probe position by 
  <UL>
  <LI>collecting all the probe pairs that fell within a window of &#177
  30 bp.

  <LI>calculating all non-redundant pairwise averages of PM - MM
  values of all probe pairs in the window.

  <LI>taking the median of all resulting pairwise averages.
  </UL>
<LI>The resulting signal value is the Hodges-Lehmann estimator
associated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic of the PM - MM
values that lie within &#177 30 bp of the sliding window centered at
every genomic coordinate.
