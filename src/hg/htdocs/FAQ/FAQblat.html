<h2>BLAT vs. BLAST</h2>
<h6>What are the differences between BLAT and BLAST?</h6>
<p>
BLAT is an alignment tool like BLAST, but it is structured differently. On DNA, BLAT works by 
keeping an index of an entire genome in memory. Thus, the target database of BLAT is not a set of 
GenBank sequences, but instead an index derived from the assembly of the entire genome. By default,
the index consists of all non-overlapping 11-mers except for those heavily involved in repeats, and 
it uses less than a gigabyte of RAM. This smaller size means that BLAT is far more easily 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/mirror.html">mirrored</a> than BLAST. Blat of DNA is designed to quickly find 
sequences of 95% and greater similarity of length 40 bases or more. It may miss more divergent or 
shorter sequence alignments. (The default settings and expected behavior of standalone Blat are 
slightly different from those on the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgBlat">graphical version of BLAT</a>.)</p>
<p>
On proteins, BLAT uses 4-mers rather than 11-mers, finding protein sequences of 80% and greater 
similarity to the query of length 20+ amino acids. The protein index requires slightly more than 
2 gigabytes of RAM. In practice -- due to sequence divergence rates over evolutionary time -- DNA 
BLAT works well within humans and primates, while protein Blat continues to find good matches within
terrestrial vertebrates and even earlier organisms for conserved proteins. Within humans, protein 
Blat gives a much better picture of gene families (paralogs) than DNA Blat. However, BLAST and 
psi-BLAST at NCBI can find much more remote matches.</p>
<p>
From a practical standpoint, BLAT has several advantages over BLAST:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>
  speed (no queues, response in seconds) at the price of lesser homology depth</li>
  <li>
  the ability to submit a long list of simultaneous queries in fasta format</li>
  <li>
  five convenient output sort options</li>
  <li>
  a direct link into the UCSC browser</li>
  <li>
  alignment block details in natural genomic order</li>
  <li>
  an option to launch the alignment later as part of a custom track</li>
</ul>
<p>
BLAT is commonly used to look up the location of a sequence in the genome or determine the exon 
structure of an mRNA, but expert users can run large batch jobs and make internal parameter 
sensitivity changes by installing command-line Blat on their own Linux server.</p>

<a name="blat1b"></a>
<h2>BLAT can't find a sequence or not all expected matches</h2>
<h6>I can't find a sequence with BLAT although I'm sure it is in the genome. Am I doing 
something wrong?</h6>
<p>
First, check if you are using the correct version of the genome. For example, two versions of the 
human genome are currently in wide use (hg19 and hg38) and your sequence may be only in one of
them. Many published articles do not specify the assembly version so trying both may be necessary.</p>
<p>
Very short sequences that go over a splice site in a cDNA sequence can't be found, as they are not 
in the genome. qPCR primers are a typical example. For these cases, try using 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgPcr">In-Silico PCR</a> and selecting a gene set as the target. In general, 
the In-Silico PCR tool is more sensitive and should be preferred for pairs of primers.</p>
<p>
Another problematic case is searching for sequences in repeats or transposons.
BLAT skips the most repetitive parts of the query and limits the number of matches it finds, 
leading to missing matches for these repeat sequences.
The online version of BLAT masks 11mers from the query that occur more than 1024 times in the 
genome and limits results to 16 matches per chromosome strand. This means that at most 32 locations
per chromosome are returned. This is done to improve speed, but can result in missed hits when you
are searching for sequences in repeats.</p>
<p>
Often for repeat sequences, you can use the 
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=chainSelf">self-chain track</a> to 
find the other matches, but only if the other matches are long and specific enough. You can 
check whether any sequence is present at a particular location 
by using the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=oligoMatch">"Short match" track</a> 
if your sequence is less than 30 bp.
You can work around this minimum length limitation by adding more flanking sequence to your query
to make the query unique enough. If this is not possible, the only alternative is to download 
the executables of BLAT and the .2bit file of a genome to your own machine and use BLAT on 
the command line. See <a href="#blat3">Downloading BLAT source and documentation</a> for 
more information. When using the command line version of BLAT, you can set the repMatch 
option to a large value to try to improve finding matches in repetitive regions and do not
use one of the default 11.ooc repeat masking files.</p>

<a name="blat1c"></a>
<h2>BLAT or In-Silico PCR finds multiple matches such as chr_alt or chr_fix even though only one is expected</h2>
<h6>I am seeing two or more matches in the genome although there should only be one. What are these 
extra matches?</h6>
<p>
This usually occurs on the newer genome assemblies, such as hg38, when you search a sequence that
has an &quot;alternate&quot; or &quot;fix&quot; sequence. To improve the quality of the these 
assemblies, curators have added multiple versions of some important loci, e.g. the MHC regions. 
They also add fix sequences to resolve errors without changing the reference. See our <a 
target="_blank" href="https://genome-blog.gi.ucsc.edu/blog/patches/">patches blog post</a> for more 
information.</p>
<p>
When you blat or isPCR a sequence which matches a chromosome location that also has a fix or alt 
sequence, you will see a match on the reference chromosome (e.g. &quot;chr1&quot;) and another 
match on the patch sequence (e.g. chr1_KN196472v1_fix). In most cases it is safe to ignore the 
patch hit, as a human genome will not contain both the reference and alternate sequence at the 
same time. For more information on the specific kinds of patch sequences see our <a target="_blank" 
href="FAQdownloads#downloadAlt">FAQ entry</a> on the topic.</p>

<a name="blat2"></a>
<h2>BLAT usage restrictions</h2>
<h6>I received a warning from your Blat server informing me that I had exceeded the server use 
limitations. Can you give me information on the UCSC Blat server use parameters?</h6>
<p>
Due to the high demand on our Blat servers, we restrict service for users who programmatically
query the BLAT tool or do large batch queries. Program-driven use of BLAT is limited to a maximum
of one hit every 15 seconds and no more than 5,000 hits per day. Please limit batch queries to 25 
sequences or less.</p> 
<p>
For users with high-volume Blat demands, we recommend downloading the BLAT tool for local use. For more 
information, see <a href="#blat3">Downloading BLAT source and documentation</a>.</p>

<a name="blat3"></a>
<h2>Downloading BLAT source and documentation</h2>
<h6>Is the BLAT source available for download? Is documentation available?</h6>
<p>
BLAT source and executables are freely available for academic, nonprofit and personal use. 
Commercial licensing information is available on the <a href="http://www.kentinformatics.com" 
target="_blank">Kent Informatics website</a>.</p>
<p>
BLAT source may be downloaded from 
<a href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/">http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/</a> (located 
at /kent/src/blat within the most recent jksrci*.zip source tree). For BLAT executables, go to 
<a href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/</a> 
and choose your machine type.</p>
<p>
Documentation on BLAT program specifications is available 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html">here</a>. Note that the command-line BLAT 
does not return matches to U nucleotides in the query sequence.</p>

<a name="blat5"></a>
<h2>Replicating web-based Blat parameters in command-line version</h2>
<h6>I'm setting up my own Blat server and would like to use the same parameter values that the 
UCSC web-based Blat server uses.</h6> 
<p>
We almost always <strong>expect small differences</strong> between the hgBLAT/gfServer and the 
stand-alone, command-line Blat. The best matches can be found using pslReps and pslCDnaFilter 
utilities. The web-based Blat is tuned permissively with a minimum cut-off score of 20, which will 
display most of the alignments. We advise deciding which 
filtering parameters make the most sense for the experiment or analysis. Often these settings will 
be different and more stringent than those of the web-based Blat. With that in mind, use the 
following settings to approximate the search results of the web-based Blat:</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> There are cases where the gfServer/gfClient approach provide a better
approximation of web results than standalone Blat. See the <a href="#blat11">example below</a>
for an overview of this process.</p>
<p>
<em>standalone Blat</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blat search:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>blat -stepSize=5 -repMatch=2253 -minScore=20 -minIdentity=0
  database.2bit query.fa output.psl </code><br></li>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> To replicate web results, PSL output should be used. BLAT handles
  alternative output formats (such as blast8) slightly differently, and this can lead to minor
  differences in results; particularly for short alignments. Furthermore, the query sequence
  should have all U nucleotides converted to T nucleotides or have the "-q=rna" flag used
  to match the web-BLAT.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>faToTwoBit</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses soft masking to convert Fasta format to the 2bit format for BLAT input.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>gfServer</em> (this is how the UCSC web-based BLAT servers are configured):
<ul>
  <li>
  BLAT server (capable of PCR):<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gfServer start blatMachine portX -stepSize=5 -log=untrans.log 
  database.2bit</code></li>
  <li>
  translated BLAT server:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gfServer start blatMachine portY -trans -mask -log=trans.log 
  database.2bit</code> </li>
</ul>
<p>For enabling DNA/DNA and DNA/RNA matches, only the host, port and twoBit files are needed. The 
same port is used for both untranslated Blat (gfClient) and PCR (webPcr). You'll need a separate 
Blat server on a separate port to enable translated Blat (protein searches or translated searches 
in protein-space).</p>
<p>
<em>gfClient</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set <em>-minScore=0</em> and <em>-minIdentity=0</em>. This will result in some low-scoring, 
  generally spurious hits, but for interactive use it's sufficiently easy to ignore them (because 
  results are sorted by score) and sometimes the low-scoring hits come in handy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Notes on repMatch:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The default setting for gfServer dna matches is: repMatch = 1024 * (tileSize/stepSize).</li>
  <li>
  The default setting for Blat dna matches is: repMatch = 1024 (if tileSize=11).</li>
  <li>To get command-line results that are equivalent to web-based results, repMatch must be 
  specified when using BLAT.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information about how to replicate the score and percent identity matches displayed by our 
web-based Blat, please see this <a href="../FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat4">BLAT FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>
For more information on the parameters available for BLAT, gfServer, and gfClient, see the 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html">BLAT specifications</a>.</p>

<a name="blat6"></a>
<h2>Using the <em>-ooc</em> flag</h2>
<h6>What does the <em>-ooc</em> flag do?</h6>
<p>
Using any <em>-ooc</em> option in BLAT, such as <em>-ooc=11.ooc</em>, speeds up searches similar to 
repeat-masking sequence. The <em>11.ooc</em> file contains sequences determined to be 
over-represented in the genome sequence. To improve search speed, these sequences are not used when 
seeding an alignment against the genome. For reasonably sized sequences, this will not create a 
problem and will significantly reduce processing time.</p>
<p>
By not using the <em>11.ooc</em> file, you will increase alignment time, but will also slightly 
increase sensitivity. This may be important if you are aligning shorter sequences or sequences of 
poor quality. For example, if a particular sequence consists primarily of sequences in the 
<em>11.ooc</em> file, it will never be seeded correctly for an alignment if the <em>-ooc</em> flag 
is used.</p>
<p>
In summary, if you are not finding certain sequences and can afford the extra processing time, you 
may want to run BLAT without the <em>11.ooc</em> file if your particular situation warrants its 
use.</p>

<a name="blat4"></a>
<h2>Replicating web-based Blat percent identity and score calculations</h2>
<h6>Using my own command-line Blat server, how can I replicate the percent identity and score 
calculations produced by web-based Blat?</h6>
<p>
There is no option to command-line Blat that gives you the percent ID and the score. However, we 
have created scripts that include the calculations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
  View the perl script from the source tree: 
  <a href="http://genome-source.soe.ucsc.edu/gitlist/kent.git/raw/master/src/utils/pslScore/pslScore.pl">
  <code>pslScore.pl</code></a></li>
  <li>
  View the corresponding C program:
  <a href="http://genome-source.soe.ucsc.edu/gitlist/kent.git/raw/master/src/utils/pslScore/pslScore.c">
  <code>pslScore.c</code></a>
  and associated library functions <code>pslScore</code> and <code>pslCalcMilliBad</code> in   
  <a href="http://genome-source.soe.ucsc.edu/gitlist/kent.git/raw/master/src/lib/psl.c">
  <code>psl.c</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>

obtaining the source.</p>

<a name="blat7"></a>
<h2>Replicating web-based Blat &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; search results</h2>
<h6>How do I generate the same search results as web-based Blat's &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; 
option using command-line Blat?</h6>
<p>
The code for the &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; Blat search orders the results based on the sort 
output option that you selected on the query page. It then returns the highest-scoring alignment of 
the first query sequence.</p>
<p>
If you are sorting results by &quot;query, start&quot; or &quot;chrom, start&quot;, generating the 
&quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot; result is straightforward: sort the output file by these columns, then
select the top result.</p>
<p>
To replicate any of the sort options involving score, you first must calculate the score for each 
result in your PSL output file, then sort the results by score or other combination (<em>e.g.</em> 
&quot;query, score&quot; and &quot;chrom, score&quot;). See the section on 
<a href="#blat4">Replicating web-based Blat percent identity and score calculations</a> for 
information on calculating the score.</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can try filtering your Blat PSL output using either the
<code>pslReps</code> or 
<code>pslCDnaFilter</code> program available in the Genome Browser source code. For information on 
obtaining the source code, see our <a href="FAQlicense.html">FAQ</a> on source code licensing and 
downloads.</p>

<a name="blat8"></a>
<h2>Using BLAT for short sequences with maximum sensitivity</h2>
<h6>How do I configure BLAT for short sequences with maximum sensitivity?</h6> 
<p>
Here are some guidelines for configuring standalone Blat and gfServer/gfClient for these 
conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  The formula to find the shortest query size that will guarantee a match (if matching tiles are not
  marked as overused) is: 2 * <em>stepSize</em> + <em>tileSize</em> - 1 <br>
  For example, with <em>stepSize</em> set to 5 and <em>tileSize</em> set to 11, matches of query 
  size 2 * 5 + 11 - 1 = 20 bp will be found if the query matches the target exactly.<br>
  The <em>stepSize</em> parameter can range from 1 to <em>tileSize</em>.<br>
  The <em>tileSize</em> parameter can range from 6 to 15. For protein, the range starts lower.<br>
  For <em>minMatch</em>=1 (e.g., protein), the minimum guaranteed match length is: 1 * 
  <em>stepSize</em> + <em>tileSize</em> - 1<br>
  Note: There is also a &quot;minimum lucky size&quot; for hits. This is the smallest possible hit 
  that BLAT can find. This minimum lucky size can be calculated using the formula: <em>stepSize</em>
  + <em>tileSize</em>. For example, if we use a <em>tileSize</em> of 11 and <em>stepSize</em> of 5, 
  hits smaller than 16 bases won't be reported.</li>
  <li>
  Try using <em>-fine</em>.</li>
  <li>
  Use a large value for <em>repMatch</em> (e.g. <em>-repMatch</em> = 1000000) to reduce the chance 
  of a tile being marked as over-used.</li>
  <li>
  Do not use an <em>.ooc</em> file.</li>
  <li>
  Do not use <em>-fastMap</em>.</li>
  <li>
  Do not use masking command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The above changes will make BLAT more sensitive, but will also slow the speed and increase the 
memory usage. It may be necessary to process one chromosome at a time to reduce the memory 
requirements.</p>
<p>
A note on filtering output: increasing the <em>-minScore</em> parameter value beyond one-half of 
the query size has no further effect.  Therefore, use either the <code>pslReps</code> or 
<code>pslCDnaFilter</code> program available in the Genome Browser source code to filter for the size, 
score, coverage, or quality desired. For information on obtaining the source code, see our 
<a href="FAQlicense.html">FAQ</a> on source code licensing and downloads.</p>

<a name="blat9"></a>
<h2>Blat ALL genomes</h2>
<h6>How do I blat queries for the default genome assemblies of all organisms?</h6>
<p>
BLAT is designed to quickly find sequence similarity between query and target sequences. 
Generally, BLAT is used to find locations of sequence homology in a single target genome or determine
 the exon structure of an mRNA. BLAT also allows users to compare the query sequence against all of 
the default assemblies for organisms hosted on the UCSC Genome Browser. The <em>Search ALL</em> feature
may be useful if you have an ambiguous query sequence and are trying to determine what organism it may
belong to.
</p>
<p>
Selecting the "Search ALL" 
checkbox above the Genome drop-down list allows you to search the genomes
of the default assemblies for all of our organisms. It also searches any attached hubs' 
Blat servers, meaning you can search your user-generated assembly hubs. 
<br>
<br>
The new dynamic BLAT servers allow one to perform BLAT searches on an unlimited number of genomes with a fixed amount of memory,
however it takes time to swap virtual pages from the storage device.
Currently dynamic BLAT servers are not supported for "Search ALL", and they are noted as skipped in the output.
<br>
<br>
The results page displays an ordered list 
of all our organisms and their homology with your query sequence. The results are ordered 
so that the organism with the best alignment score is at the top, indicating which region(s) 
of that organism has the greatest homology with your query sequence.
The entire alignment, including mismatches and gaps, must <a href="../FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat4">score</a>  
20 or higher in order to appear in the Blat output. By clicking into a link in the <em>Assembly list</em> 
you will be taken to a new page displaying various locations and scores of sequence homology in the assembly of interest.
</p>

<a name="blat10"></a>
<h2>Blat ALL genomes: No matches found</h2>
<h6>My Blat ALL results display assemblies with hits, but clicking into them reports 
no matches</h6>

<p>
In the Blat ALL results page, the "Hits" column does not represent alignments, instead it reports 
tile hits. Tile hits are 11 base kmer matches found in the target, which do not necessarily 
represent successful alignments. When one clicks the 'Assembly' link a full Blat alignment for 
that genome will occur and any alignment scores representing less than a 20 bp result will 
come back as no matches found.</p>

<p>
When you submit a sequence to the Blat ALL utility, the sequence is compared to an index in the 
server. The index has been built from the target genome, with an 11bp default stepSize.
These 11-mers &quot;tile&quot; the sequence as such:

<pre>
TGGACAACATG
           GCAAGAATCAG
                      TCTCTACAGAA
</pre></p>

<p>
After the index is built, the first step of alignment is to read the query (search) sequence, 
extract all the 11-mers, and look those up in the genome 11-mer index currently in memory. 
Matches found there represent the initial &quot;hits&quot; you see in the Blat ALL results page. 
The next step is to look for hits that overlap or fall within a certain distance of each other, 
and attempt to align the sequences between the hit locations in target and query.</p>

<p>
For example, if two 11-base tile hits align perfectly, it would result in a score of 22. This is 
above the minimum required score of 20 (see <a href="#blat9">Blat ALL genomes</a>), and would be 
reported as an alignment. However, there are penalties for gaps and mismatches, as well as potential 
overlap (see stepsize in <a href="../goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html">BLAT specifications</a>), all 
of which could bring the score below 20. In that case, Blat ALL would report 2 &quot;hits&quot;, 
but clicking into the assembly would report no matches. This most often occurs when there are 
only a few (1-3) hits reported by Blat ALL.</p>

<a name="blat11"></a>
<h2>Approximating web-based Blat results using gfServer/gfClient</h2>

<p>
Often times using the gfServer/gfClient provides a better approximation or even replicate of
the web-based Blat results, which otherwise cannot be found using standalone Blat. This approach
mimics the Blat server used by the Genome Browser web-based Blat. The following example will show
how to set up an hg19 gfServer, then make a query. First, download the appropriate utility for
the operating system and give it executable permissions:</p>
<pre>
#For linux
rsync -a rsync://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/genome/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/blat/ ./
#For MacOS
rsync -a rsync://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/genome/admin/exe/macOSX.x86_64/blat/ ./

chmod +x gfServer gfClient blat
</pre>
<p>
Next, download the appropriate .2bit genome (hg19 in this example), and run the gfServer
utility with the web Blat parameters, designating the local machine and port 1234:</p>
<pre>
wget http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/hg19.2bit
./gfServer start 127.0.0.1 1234 -stepSize=5 hg19.2bit
</pre>
<p>
After a few moments, the gfServer will initialize and be ready to recieve queries. In order
to approximate web Blat, we will use the gfClient with the following parameters, designating
our input and output files.</p>
<pre>
./gfClient -minScore=20 -minIdentity=0 127.0.0.1 1234 . input.fa out.psl
</pre>
<p>The output file <code>out.psl</code> should have results very similar to web-based Blat.</p>

<a name="blat12"></a>
<h2>Standalone or gfServer/gfClient result start positions off by one</h2>
<h6>My standalone Blat results or gfServer/gfClient Blat results have a start
position that is one less that what I see on web Blat results</h6>
<p>
This is due to how we store internal coordinates in the Genome Browser. The default
Blat <strong>Output type</strong> of <strong>hyperlink</strong> shows results in our
internal coordinate data structure. These internal coordinates have a zero-based start
and a one-based end. See the following <a target="_blank" href="/FAQ/FAQtracks#tracks1"
>FAQ entry</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
If the <strong>Output type</strong> is changed to <strong>psl</strong> on web Blat, the same
zero-based half open coordinate results will be seen as the standalone Blat and gfServer/gfClient 
procedures.</p>

<a name="blat13"></a>
<h2>Protein-translated BLAT having different results</h2>
<p>
Protein-translated BLAT (protein or translated RNA queries) uses the standard vertebrate
genetic code. It will be slightly less sensitive on mitochondria and species using other
genetic codes. More information on standard genetic codes can be found on the
<a target="_blank"
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=cgencodes">
NCBI website</a>. Additional details on mitochondria codon tables can be found on
the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables">Wikiwand website</a>.
</p>

<a name="blat14"></a>
<h2>Querying BLAT programmatically using URLs</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b> Open programmatic access was removed in 2025 due to bot abuse. If you would like
to request access, please <a href="/contacts.html">contact us</a>. Keep in mind that BLAT can also
be run <a href="#blat15">locally</a>, which can lead to improved performance. A <a target="_blank"
href="https://kentinformatics.com/">license</a> is required for commercial use of the local BLAT utility.
</p>
<p>
The following entry explains the usage of our programmatic access, although programmatic usage will not work
without special access. BLAT supports URL queries which are returned as psl format in a JSON structure. 
The URL requires three variables: the sequence to blat, the type of query and the database, as follows</p>
<pre>
https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?userSeq=[seq]&amp;type=[type]&amp;db=[database]&amp;output=json</pre>
<p>
If the sequence is longer than 8kbp, the request must be sent via HTTP POST.
</p>
<p>
Query types include DNA, protein, translated RNA and translated DNA:</p>

<h2>Running BLAT Locally</h2>
<h6>How do I run BLAT locally if I'm running into limitations with the web-based version?</h6>
<p>
If you have access to a Linux or Mac OSX command-line you can run <code>blat</code> locally.
The blat binary is available under the directory for your system type under the
<a href="https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/">utilities directory</a> on our download server.
<p>
Once you have the downloaded the <code>blat</code> program to your computer, ensure the 'execute' bit is
on for permissions:
<pre><code>$ ls -og blat
-rwxrwxr-x 1 5528712 Nov  7 04:03 blat
</code></pre>
<p>
If the permissions indicate something like: <code>-rw-rw-r--</code>, then
you will need to enable the ability to execute the program:
<pre><code>$ chmod +x blat</code></pre>
<p>
To confirm that it works, run the program without arguments. This will also
display the help message.
<pre><code>$ ./blat</code></pre>
<p>
You can now use this program locally on your sequences. For example, given a
sample.fa, to find that sequence in the human/hg38 genome, you would run:
<pre><code>$ ./blat hg38.2bit sample.fa output.psl</code></pre>
<p>
You can download the 2bit file for your assembly of interest from the
<a href="https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">download server</a>
under the &quot;Genome sequence files and select annotations (2bit, GTF,
GC-content, etc)&quot; link. For example, the hg38.2bit sequence can be found <a
href="https://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/">here</a>.
