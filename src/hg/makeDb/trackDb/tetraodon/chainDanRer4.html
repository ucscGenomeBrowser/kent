<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows alignments of $o_Organism ($o_db, $o_date) to the
$Organism genome using a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps 
than traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also tolerate gaps in both
$o_Organism and $Organism simultaneously. These 
&quot;double-sided&quot; gaps can be caused by local inversions and 
overlapping deletions in both species. 
<P>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
$o_Organism assembly or an insertion in the $Organism 
assembly.  Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of
the $Organism genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often 
due to processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more 
often due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes.</P> 
<P>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</P>
<P>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The genomes were aligned with Blastz and no lineage-specific repeats were 
used. $Organism has no species-specific repeats for RepeatMasker; 
therefore, dynamic masking was used for the Blastz alignments because it is 
likely that not all the repeats in the $o_Organism genome are masked. The 
resulting alignments were converted into axt format using the lavToAxt program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all alignments 
between a single $o_Organism chromosome and a single $Organism 
chromosome 
into a group and creates a kd-tree out of the gapless subsections (blocks) 
of the alignments. A dynamic program was then run over the kd-trees to find 
the maximally scoring chains of these blocks. 

$matrix

Chains scoring below a threshold were discarded; the remaining chains are 
displayed in this track.</P>
