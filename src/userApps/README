UCSC genome browser 'kent' bioinformatic utilities

  These are only the command line bioinformatic utilities
  from the kent source tree.  This is not the genome browser install.
  For the genome browser install, use the instructions from the source tree:
    http://genome-source.cse.ucsc.edu/gitweb/?p=kent.git;a=tree;f=src/product

========================================================================
Pre-compiled binaries available:

These binaries built at UCSC may already work in your linux/Mac
environment.  Please access via:
  http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/
  http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/macOSX.x86_64/
  http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/macOSX.i386/

Or via FTP:
  ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/

========================================================================

System Requirements:

Linux/Ubuntu/CentOS/Unix/MacOSX operating system
gnu gcc - C code development system - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/
gnu make - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
MySQL development system and libraries - http://dev.mysql.com/
libpng runtime and development packages - http://www.libpng.org/
libssl runtime and development packages - http://www.openssl.org/

Optional:
'git' source code management: http://git-scm.com/downloads

It is best to install these packages with your standard operating
system package management tools.
    (see notes below about installing packages)

========================================================================

1. Fetch the userApps directory:

   Alternative to 'git' command, a gzipped tar file is available
   with all the source, via FTP or HTTP:
     ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/apache/htdocs/admin/exe/userApps.src.tgz
     http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/userApps.src.tgz

   Unpacking that file (tar xvzf userApps.src.tgz)
   creates a directory: ./userApps/
   with all the source.  Proceed to step 2 to build this directory.

   Using 'git' to fetch the source, creates a directory ./userApps/

   git archive --format=zip -9 \
      --remote=git://genome-source.cse.ucsc.edu/kent.git \
      beta src/userApps > userApps.zip
   unzip -d userApps -j userApps.zip
   cd userApps
   make fetchSource

2. Build the utilities:

   cd userApps
   make

   This build fetches (with git) approximately 200 Mb/7,800 files of
      kent source code, and constructs about 223 command binaries
      of approximate size near 600 Mb.
   The resulting binaries are in ./userApps/bin/

   Note: there are no required shell environment settings as discussed
         in the genome browser build instructions.  In fact, this build
         system will ignore and override any shell environment settings
         you may have for the genome browser build environment.

3. Install utilities

   The binaries are built into ./userApps/bin/
   To install them in a global bin/ directory, copy them
   to a desired location, e.g.:

      sudo rsync -a -P ./userApps/bin/ /usr/local/bin/kentUtils/

   The destination bin/kentUtils/ should be its own unique directory
   to avoid overwriting same-named binaries in a standard bin/ directory.

   Users add '/usr/local/bin/kentUtils' to their shell PATH
   to access the commands.

4. Update utilities

   This procedure expects the 'git' command to be available.
   Without the 'git' command, run a 'make clean' to clean up the
   existing source tree, then repeat the fetch and unpack of the
   userApps.src.tgz file as mentioned in step 1.

   With the 'git' command available, the 'make update' will refresh
   the source tree and rebuild:

   cd userApps
   make update

   This runs a 'make clean' in the source tree, fetches all
   the source again, unpacks it to overlay the existing source tree,
   then runs a 'make utils' to rebuild everything.

5. There are 'parasol' binaries built into ./userApps/kent/src/parasol/bin/
   Use these binaries to set up a job control system on a compute cluster
   or large machine with many CPU cores.  See also:
     http://genecats.cse.ucsc.edu/eng/parasol.htm
   for more information.  The usage messages from each command will help
   with the setup.

========================================================================

Documentation:

Each 'kent' command contains its own documentation.  Simply run the
commands without any arguments to see the usage message for operating
instructions.

When the utilities are built here, their usage messages have
been collected together in one file:
	kentUtils.Documentation.txt

========================================================================

Installing required packages:

On a MacOS system, you will need the XCode system installed:
   https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
And the Mac Ports install system: http://www.macports.org/

With the Mac ports and XCode systems installed, you can install
the additional packages required (and helpful):

  sudo port install git-core gnutls rsync libpng mysql55 openssl curl wget

On a typical Linux system, for example Ubuntu, use the apt-get command
to install additional packages:

   sudo apt-get install git libssl-dev openssl mysql-client-5.1 \
      mysql-client-core-5.1

Depending upon the version of your Linux/Ubuntu/CentOS operating system,
the specific version of packages you need may be different than this example.

Please use your standard operating system package management
install system (e.g. 'yum' on CentOS) to obtain correct versions of
these packages for your specific operating system version.

========================================================================

Known Problems:

   Please advise UCSC if you have the recommended installed libraries
   and development system and this build will not function.
   email to:  genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu

1. These procedures will not work as-is on sparc or alpha machines or
   with the Sun Solaris operating system.
