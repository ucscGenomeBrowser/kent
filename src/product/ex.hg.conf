#  New browser function as of April 2007, custom track data is kept
#	in a database instead of in trash files.  This function requires
#	several other factors to be in place before it will work.
#  In this first implementation, this is an optional feature, but
#	approximately by the end of the year 2007, this will be required.
#
#	See also:
#	http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php?title=Using_custom_track_database
#  Uncomment these settings and provide host, user, and password settings
# customTracks.host=<your specific host name>

#	tmpdir of /data/tmp is the default location if not specified here
#	Set this to a directory as recommended in the genomewiki
#	discussion mentioned above.
