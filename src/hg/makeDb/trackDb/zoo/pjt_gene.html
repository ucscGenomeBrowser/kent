<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays NISC-generated, curated gene annotations for the human
genome and each of the zoo species.  Coding exons are depicted taller than 5' 
and 3'
untranslated regions (UTR).  Connecting introns are one-pixel lines with
hatch marks indicating direction of transcription.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Exon locations of known genes were determined by aligning human and/or mouse
reference cDNA sequences with the assembled genomic sequence of each species. 
When splice site consensus, exon structure, or protein translation errors
were encountered, they were manually inspected and corrected.</P>
