The alignments in this track were generated using the 
<A HREF="http://lagan.stanford.edu/lagan_web/index.shtml" TARGET=_blank>LAGAN</A>
Alignment Toolkit. The Genome Browser companion tracks, MLAGAN Cons and MLAGAN Elements, 
display conservation scoring and conserved elements for these alignments based 
on various conservation methods.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
In full display mode, this track shows pairwise alignments
of each species aligned to the human genome.  
In dense mode, the alignments are depicted using a gray-scale
density gradient.  The checkboxes in the track configuration section allow
the exclusion of species from the pairwise display.</P>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the base-display level, the track shows the base
composition of each alignment. The numbers and symbols on the &quot;Gaps&quot; 
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the human sequence at those
alignment positions relative to the longest non-human sequence. If there is
sufficient space in the display, the size of the gap is shown; if not, and if
the gap size is a multiple of 3, a &quot;*&quot; is displayed, 
otherwise &quot;+&quot; is shown.
To view detailed information about the
alignments at a specific position, zoom in the display to 30,000 or fewer
bases, then click on the alignment.  </P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
MLAGAN alignments were produced by a pipeline specifically designed for
ENCODE. First, <A HREF="http://www.advbiocomp.com/blast.html" TARGET=_blank>AB-BLAST</A> was 
used to find local similarities (anchors) 
between the human sequence and the sequence of every other species. Then, 
Shuffle-LAGAN was used to calculate the highest-scoring
human-monotonic 
chain of these local similarities (according to a scoring scheme that 
penalized evolutionary rearrangements), and &mdash; with the help of a utility 
called SuperMap &mdash; produce a map of orthologous segments, in increasing 
human coordinates. This map was used to undo the genomic rearrangements of the 
other sequence and convert it to a form that was directly alignable to the
human sequence. The new humanized sequences, together with the human 
sequence, were then multiply aligned using 
<A HREF="http://lagan.stanford.edu/lagan_web/index.shtml" TARGET=_blank>MLAGAN</A>.
The resulting alignments were subsequently refined using 
<A HREF="http://www.drive5.com/muscle/" TARGET=_blank>MUSCLE</A>, which 
processed small non-overlapping alignment windows and realigned them in an
iterative fashion, keeping the refined alignment if it had a better 
sum-of-pairs score than the original.  Finally, a pairwise refinement
round was performed, during which the pieces that had very low identity (in the 
induced pairwise alignments between human and each species) were removed 
from the alignment.</P>
