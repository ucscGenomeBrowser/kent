<h2> Description </h2>

<p>Silencers and enhancer-blockers (EBs) are cis-acting, negative regulatory elements (NREs) that 
control interactions between promoters and enhancers. Although relatively uncharacterized in terms 
of biological mechanisms, these elements are likely to be abundant in the genome. Examples of NREs 
include silencers, which decrease expression of a gene under their regulation and enhancer-blocking 
(EB) elements, which prevent the action of an enhancer on a promoter when placed between the two, but 
not otherwise. Examples of NREs are extremely limited. EB and silencer assays typically require 
integration of the reporter gene into the chromatin of genomic DNA. The process is too laborious to 
use in large-scale analyses. To improve scalability, our system uses non-integrated recombinant plasmids, 
which have been shown to support EB activity. We evaluated silencing and EB function in genomic sequences 
by developing a transient transfection assay suitable for high-throughput screening. To ensure that we 
identified elements capable of overcoming the effects of strong enhancers, the assay utilizes an enhancer 
from the human beta-globin locus control region. Known as DNase I hypersensitive site II (HS2) this enhancer 
is functional in multiple cell lines, with multiple promoters. The presence of HS2 provides a large window 
of expression to reliably measure loss-of-function effects.

<h2> Methods </h2>
<p>Transfection of Cells and Measurement of Expression. To assess transient expression, 4 x 105 K562 cells 
and 6 x 104 HeLa or 293T cells were transfected with 0.4 micrograms of test DNA and 4.0 or 40 nanograms of 
pRL-Tk Renilla plasmid for lipofection (using the reagent TFX-50) or electroporation (using the Amaxa 96-well 
nucleofector II). Both approaches used Renilla luciferase as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase 
expression was measured in a 96-well plate format with detection of fluorescence using the dual luciferase 
?Stop and Glo? procedure from Promega. Measurements were recorded on a Berthold plate-reader luminometer. The 
average expression level from three replicate transfections was normalized to the Renilla luciferase co-transfection 
control. This value was further normalized to the average expression level from three normalized replicates of 
the promoter-only plasmid to yield a ?fold? enhancement measurement. Upon producing a silencing phenotype, each 
construct was re-sequenced to confirm the integrity of the plasmid.
