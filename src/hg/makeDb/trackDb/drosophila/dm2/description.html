<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, an Ensembl transcript ID, or keywords
from the Genbank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
The 118.4 Mb Release 4 euchromatic sequence, provided by BDGP, 
contains 6 euchromatic chromosome arms with a total of 23 sequence gaps
(chr2L, chr2R, chr3L, chr3R, chr4, chrX).  
The assembly was validated in collaboration with the Genome Sciences
Centre at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada,
using fingerprint analysis of a tiling path of BACs spanning the
genome.
<P>
The Release 3.2 heterochromatic sequence, provided by DHGP, is based
on 20.7 Mb of Release 3 whole-genome-shotgun (WGS) scaffolds from
Celera that could not be assembled into the euchromatin arms as well
as a few BDGP-sequenced scaffolds.  The scaffolds have been assigned to 
chromosomes where possible (chr2h, chr3h, chr4h, chrXh, chrYh; chrU 
contains scaffolds that could not be assigned to a chromosome).

The dm2 annotation tracks were generated by UCSC and collaborators worldwide.  
Thanks to BDGP, DHGP, and the Flybase Consortium for
providing the sequence, assembly, gene annotations and analysis of this 
genome. See the
