"The <em>Caenorhabditis remanei</em> genome was sequenced to a depth of 9.2X using
using plasmid and fosmid libraries made from DNA extracted from a
mixed population of females and males from all developmental stages.
Coverage was based on an expected genome size of 130 Mb. The whole-genome
shotgun plasmid and fosmid paired-end reads were assembled using PCAP
(Genome Res. 13(9):2164-70 2003).  The sequence can be downloaded
from the <A HREF="ftp://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Invertebrates/Caenorhabditis_remanei/assembly/Caenorhabditis_remanei-15.0.1/output"

The UCSC Genome browser displays the 3,670 scaffolds as a single
artifical chromosome, chrUn. There are 138,406,203 base pairs of sequence
with 10,705,348 N's in gaps.
