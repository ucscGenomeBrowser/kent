<font size="3"><b>12 Sept 2013 - New UDR ENCODE Download Method Available
</b></font>
<p>
The UCSC Genome Browser is pleased to offer a new download protocol to use when downloading
large sets of files from our download servers: UDR (UDT Enabled Rsync). UDR utilizes rsync
as the transport mechanism but sends the data over the UDT protocol, which is very efficient
at sending large amounts of data over long distances. This new protocol has been put in place
to enable huge amounts of data to be downloaded quickly over long distances.</p>
<p>
Remember that we now have two identical download servers to better serve your needs. You can use either one:
<p>
<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu</a>
<p>
<a href="http://hgdownload-sd.sdsc.edu" target="_blank">http://hgdownload-sd.sdsc.edu</a>
<p>
<h4>The Background:</h4>
<p>
Typical TCP-based protocols like http, ftp and rsync have a problem in that the further
away the download source is from you, the slower the speed becomes. Protocols like UDT/UDR
allow for many UDP packets to be sent in batch, thus allowing for much higher transmit speeds
over long distances. UDR will be especially useful for users who are downloading from places
that are far away from California. The US East Coat and the international community will likely
see much higher download speeds by using UDR rather than rsync, http or ftp.</p>
<p>
<h4>Getting UDR & Setting it up on your System:</h4>
<p>
It should be noted that UDR is not written or managed by UCSC, it was written by the
Laboratory for Advanced Computing at the University of Chicago. It has been tested to work
under Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OSX, but may work under other UNIX variants. The source code can
be obtained here, through GitHub:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR" target="_blank">https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR</a>
<p>
If you need help building the UDR binaries or have questions about how UDR functions,
please read the documentation on the GitHub page, and if necessary, contact the UDR authors
via the GitHub page. We recommend reading the documentation on the UDR GitHub page to better
understand how UDR works. UDR is written in C++. UDR is Open Source and is released under the
Apache 2.0 License. You must first have rsync installed on your system.</p>
<p>
For your convenience, we are offering a binary distribution of UDR for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.x (or variants such as CentOS 6 or Scientific Linux 6). You'll find both a 64-bit
and 32-bit rpm here:</p>
<p>
<a href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/udr" target="_blank">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/udr</a>
<p>
<h4>Using UDR to Download ENCODE Data from the UCSC Genome Browser Download Server(s):</h4>
<p>
Once you have a working UDR binary, either by building from source or by installing the rpm
(if you are using RHEL 6.x or other variant), you can download files from either of our our
download servers in a very similar fashion to rsync. For example, using rsync, you may want
to download all of the ENCODE information for the mm9 database using the following command:</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">$ rsync -avP rsync://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/ /my/local/mm9/</pre>
<p>
Using UDR is very similar. The UDR syntax for downloading the same data would be:</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">$udr rsync -avP hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu::goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/ /my/local/mm9/</pre>
<p>
If you installed the rpm, use the 'man udr' command for more information via the man page;
if you installed from source please refer to the UDR GitHub page for more details on the
capabilities of UDR and how to use it.</p>
<p>
<h4>Firewall Considerations:</h4>
<p>
UDR establishes connections on TCP/9000, then transmits the data stream over UDP/9000-9100.
Your institution may need to modify its firewall rules to allow inbound and outbound ports
TCP/9000 and UDP/9000-9100 from either of the two download machines.</p>
<p>
If you decide to install and use UDR, we hope that you experience greatly increased download
speeds. If you have difficulties installing UDR on your system, please contact the Laboratory
for Advanced Computing through their gitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR"
target="_blank">https://github.com/LabAdvComp/UDR</a>.

<font size="3"><b> 13 May 2013 - Uniform Peaks of Transcription Factor ChIP-seq from ENCODE/Analysis</b></font>
<p>
UCSC has released a new browser track containing 690 datasets of transcription factor ChIP-seq 
peaks based on data from all five ENCODE TFBS ChIP-seq production groups from the project 
inception in 2007 through the ENCODE March 2012 data freeze. 
The track covers 161 unique regulatory factors (generic and sequence-specific factors),
spanning 91 human cell types, some under various treatment conditions.</p>
<p>
Browser track: <a class="euro" target="_blank" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeAwgTfbsUniform"</a>
Transcription Factor ChIP-seq Uniform Uniform Peaks from ENCODE/Analysis</a>

<a class="euro" target="_blank" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeAwgTfbsUniform">File selection tool</a>
</p>
<p>
This track represents peak calls (regions of enrichment) generated by the ENCODE Analysis Working 
Group (AWG) using the uniform processing pipeline developed for the ENCODE Integrative Analysis
effort and published in a set of coordinated papers in September 2012. Peak calls from that
effort (based on datasets from the January 2011 ENCODE data freeze) are available at the 
ENCODE Analysis Data Hub.
The new Uniform TFBS track at UCSC includes newer data, slightly modified processing methods, 
and improved metadata.  Quality metrics are included in metadata, with detailed metrics in a 
quality spreadsheet linked to the track description.  
Browser users will see the uniform peaks first when using track search for TFBS, and 
this track is now the default track shown when the ENCODE TF Binding menu item is 
selected in the browser.
<p>
The primary and lab-processed data (along with methods descriptions, credits and references)
on which this track is based are available in the following ENCODE tracks: HAIB TFBS, SYDH TFBS,
UChicago TFBS, UTA TFBS, UW CTCF Binding.  Many thanks to Anshul Kundaje of the ENCODE AWG
for providing the uniform peaks data, description, and quality spreadsheets.</p>

<font size="3"><b> 25 January 2013 - Uniform DNaseI Hypersensitivity sites from ENCODE Analysis Working Group</b></font>
<p>
The ENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG) has performed uniform processing
on datasets produced by multiple data production groups in the ENCODE
Consortium.
The AWG uniform datasets are used in downstream analysis pipelines by
members of the ENCODE Consortium and are one of the primary sources of
data referenced in the 2012 <a target="_blank" href="analysis.html">ENCODE integrative analysis</a>.</p>
<p>
UCSC has released a new browser track and a track update based on the AWG uniform processing of

Digital DNaseI Hypersensitivity Clusters in 125 cell types from ENCODE</a>:
This track displays clusters of Uniform DNaseI Hypersensitive sites across the cell types assayed.
This is the second release of the Dnase Clusters track, which is part of the ENCODE 
Regulation supertrack in the Genome Browser. 
It contains 51 additional cell type + treatment combinations. It differs from the 
previous track by including data from multiple ENCODE groups that have been uniformly processed, 
with replicates merged. 
The previous track is available on the UCSC preview browser as 
<a target="_blank" href="http://genome-preview.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeRegDnaseClustered">DNase Clusters V1</a>.</p>
<p>
The uniform elements in these tracks are based on DNase-seq data produced by the "Open Chromatin" 
(Duke/UNC/UT-A) and University of Washington (UW) ENCODE groups from the project inception in 2007
through the ENCODE January 2011 data freeze.
The primary and lab-processed data (along with methods descriptions,
credits and references) on which these tracks are based are available in
the following ENCODE tracks:

<p>
The results of the ENCODE project were published today in a coordinated set of 30 papers published in multiple journals.
These publications are the result of cross-consortium integrative analysis, covering more than 4
million regulatory regions in the human genome mapped as part of ENCODE. The coordinated publication
set includes one main integrative paper and five other papers in the journal <em>Nature</em>; 18 papers in
<em>Genome Research</em>; and six papers in <em>Genome Biology</em>. The ENCODE data are so complex that the three
journals have developed a pioneering way to present the information in an integrated form they term
"threads." Since the same topics were addressed in different ways in different papers, the
<a target=_blank href="http://www.nature.com/encode/"><em>Nature</em> ENCODE website</a>
was developed to allow readers to follow a topic through
all of the papers in the ENCODE publication set. In addition to these publications, six review
articles are being published in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em>, and other affiliated papers in
<em>Science</em>, <em>Cell</em>, and other journals.  The new

<font size=4 color="#006666">20 August 2010 - New ENCODE Integrated Regulation Super-track Released</font><br>
 <P>
                    We are pleased to announce the release of the ENCODE Integrated
                    Regulation super-track, a collection of regulatory tracks containing
                    state-of-the-art information about the mechanisms that turn genes on and
                    off at the transcription level. Individual tracks within the set show
                    enrichment of histone modifications suggestive of enhancer and promoter
                    activity, DNAse clusters indicating open chromatin, regions of
                    transcription factor binding, and transcription levels. When viewed in
                    combination, the complementary nature of the data within these tracks
                    has the potential to greatly facilitate our understanding of regulatory
                    DNA.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                    The data comprising these tracks were generated from hundreds of
                    experiments on multiple cell lines conducted by labs participating in
                    the ENCODE project, and were submitted to
                    the UCSC ENCODE Data Coordination Center for display on the Genome
                    Browser.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                    Faced with the problem of how to display such a large amount of data
                    in a manner facilitating analysis, UCSC has developed new visualization
                    methods that cluster and overlay the data, and then display the
                    resulting tracks on a single screen. Each of the cell lines in a track
                    is associated with a particular color. Light, saturated colors are used
                    to produce the best transparent overlay.

		    <P>
		    A new ENCODE MSA sequence data freeze is available on the 
		    UCSC downloads server. The latest freeze contains 
		    sequences from 23 vertebrates provided by NISC, Baylor, 
		    the Broad Institute (2X) and the whole genome shotgun

		    <A HREF="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16/encode/alignments/MAY-2005.tgz">directory tarball</A>. 
		    Aligners are encouraged to upload alignments and related 
		    data (such as conservation scores and elements) to the 
		    UCSC ENCODE ftp site as soon as possible and then notify 
		    <A HREF="mailto:kate@soe.ucsc.edu">Kate Rosenbloom</A>. 
		    Other data, (conservation, trees, etc.) 
		    will be generated based on this dataset.</P>
		    <P>
		    The following is a summary of data updates from the
		    previous release:
		    <UL>
		    <LI>
		    The human assembly version remains at hg16 (Jul. 2003).
		    <LI>
		    The mouse assembly has been updated from mm5 (May 2004) to
		    mm6 (Mar. 2005).
		    <LI>
		    The multiple rat sequences have been replaced by a single
		    sequence: rn3 (Jun. 2003).
		    <LI>
		    The cow sequences have been updated using an assembly of 
		    BAC-based sequences provided by Baylor College of 
		    Medicine.
		    <LI>
		    Fugu (fr1), macaque (rheMac1), opossum (monDom1), 
		    Tetraodon (tetNig1), Xenopus (xenTro1), and zebrafish 
		    (danRer2) have been added.  The macaque sequence was 
		    obtained from a Baylor 
		    College of Medicine assembly that has not yet been 
		    officially released. 
		    <LI>
		    A new NISC species, rfbat 
		    (<em>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</em>), is now available.
		    <LI>
		    Platypus data from regions 
		    where NISC has not yet generated data were provided by 
		    Jim Mullikin from a preliminary assembly of Washington 
		    University WGS reads. 
		    <LI>
		    This freeze includes low-redundancy sequence data from 
		    tenrec, elephant, armadillo, and rabbit. Only one set of 
		    sequences are provided per species/target combination; 
		    where available, NISC data is provided instead of 
		    the 2X assemblies. These data are not yet accessioned at 
		    NCBI, but were made available by the Broad Institute 
		    (rabbit, elephant, armadillo) and Jim Mullikin (tenrec).
		    <LI>
		    Orthology predictions for Fugu were made only by 
		    MAVID/Mercator; predictions for all other assemblies 
		    supported by the UCSC Genome Browser represent a union 
		    with UCSC predictions as well. Because no additional 
		    post-processing was done on the Fugu predictions, they 
		    contain a few very small contigs.

		    You will notice that we have worked hard to include a 
		    number of species for which genome-wide sequence data was 
		    already available. The process by which these orthologous 
		    regions were identified is still an area of active 
		    research development, the details of which will be 
		    presented at the upcoming ENCODE meeting at CSHL.
		    <P>
		    Please note that we have also included a *second* rat 
		    sequence (ratB) in this freeze.  RatB represents an 
		    initiative to standardize the quality level of sequences 
		    in the ENCODE regions for species with genome-wide 
		    sequence data. The data were made available just before 
		    our freeze date, so we decided to include both versions of
		    the rat sequence for now. Eventually these sequences will 
		    likely be rolled into future genome assemblies.
		    <P>
		    Remember, this is a work in progress, so not all targets 
		    have sequence from all species. And some species/target 
		    combinations may not be complete yet. Progress on the
