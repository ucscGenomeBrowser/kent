<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 134, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp</A>.

Three tracks contain subsets of the items in this track:
<UL>
<LI><B>Common SNPs(134):</B> SNPs that have a minor allele frequency
    of at least 1% and are mapped to a single location in the reference
    genome assembly.  Frequency data are not available for all SNPs,
    so this subset is incomplete.</LI>
<LI><B>Flagged SNPs(134):</B> SNPs flagged as clinically associated by dbSNP, 
    mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly, and 
    <em>not</em> known to have a minor allele frequency of at least 1%.
    Frequency data are not available for all SNPs, so this subset may
    include some SNPs whose true minor allele frequency is 1% or greater.</LI>
<LI><B>Mult. SNPs(134):</B> SNPs that have been mapped to multiple locations
    in the reference genome assembly.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The default maximum <A HREF="#Weight">weight</A> for this track is 1, so unless
the setting is changed in the track controls, SNPs that map to multiple genomic 
locations will be omitted from display.  When a SNP's flanking sequences 
map to multiple locations in the reference genome, it calls into question 
whether there is true variation at those sites, or whether the sequences
at those sites are merely highly similar but not identical.
