<P>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly of chrUn, the 
&quot;unordered chromosome&quot;
for this browser. Gaps are represented as black boxes. If the relative order and 
orientation of the contigs on either side of the gap is known, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap. In this case, a white line is drawn through the 
black box representing the gap and the gap is labeled &quot;yes&quot;.

This assembly contains the following types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps within a scaffold.
<LI><B>Contig</B> - gaps between scaffolds.  These gaps, represented by 1000 
<em>N</em>s, are placeholders between scaffolds that were added as part of the 
construction of chrUn.  Because the order and orientation between the scaffolds 
is unknown, contig gaps are considered to be unbridged.
