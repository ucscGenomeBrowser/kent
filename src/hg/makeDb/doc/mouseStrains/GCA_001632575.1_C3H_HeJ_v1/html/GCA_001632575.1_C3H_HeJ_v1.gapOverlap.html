<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track indicates any pair of exactly identical sequence
on each side of gaps for the 09 May 2016 <em>Mus musculus (house mouse)</em>/GCA_001632575.1_C3H_HeJ_v1 genome assembly.<br>

Where gaps are any run of N's, including a single N.  The end of an
upstream sequence before the gap is duplicated exactly at the beginning
of the downstream sequence following the gap in the assembly.
<br>
The predictions are based on the genome sequence alone.<br>
<br>
Item count: 19,667; Bases covered: 1,306,888,247
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
These duplicate sequences were found by taking 1,000 bases before and
after each gap and aligned with the blat command:
<pre>
  blat -q=dna -minIdentity=95 -repMatch=10 upstreamContig.fa downstreamContig.fa
</pre>
Filtering the PSL output for a perfect match, no mis-matches,
and therefore of equal size matching sequence,
where the alignment ends exactly at the end of the upstream sequence,
and begins exactly at the start of the downstream sequence.
