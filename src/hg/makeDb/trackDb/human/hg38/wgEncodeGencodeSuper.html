<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The aim of the <a href="http://www.gencodegenes.org/" target="_blank">GENCODE 
Genes project</a> (Harrow <em>et al.</em>, 2006) is to produce a set of 
highly accurate annotations of evidence-based gene features on the human reference genome.
This includes the identification of all protein-coding loci with associated
alternative splice variants, non-coding with transcript evidence in the public 
databases (NCBI/EMBL/DDBJ) and pseudogenes. A high quality set of gene
structures is necessary for many research studies such as comparative or 
evolutionary analyses, or for experimental design and interpretation of the 
results.</p>
<p> 
The GENCODE Genes tracks display the high-quality manual annotations merged 
with evidence-based automated annotations across the entire
human genome. The GENCODE gene set presents a full merge
between HAVANA manual annotation and Ensembl automatic annotation.
Priority is given to the manually curated HAVANA annotation using predicted
Ensembl annotations when there are no corresponding manual annotations. With 
each release, there is an increase in the number of annotations that have undergone
manual curation.  
This annotation was carried out on the GRCh38 (hg38) genome assembly.

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<P>
These are multi-view composite tracks that contain differing data sets
(<EM>views</EM>).  Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
Only some subtracks are shown by default. The user can select which subtracks
are displayed via the display controls on the track details pages.
Further details on display conventions and data interpretation are available in the track descriptions.</p>
