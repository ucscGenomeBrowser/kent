<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
AbSplice is a method that predicts aberrant splicing across human tissues, as described in Wagner, 
Çelik et al., 2023. This track displays precomputed AbSplice scores for all possible single-nucleotide 
variants genome-wide. The scores represent the probability that a given variant causes aberrant 
splicing in a given tissue.
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice/tree/master"> AbSplice </a> scores 
can be computed from VCF files and are based on quantitative tissue-specific splice site annotations
(<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/splicemap">SpliceMaps</a>).
While SpliceMaps can be generated for any tissue of interest from a cohort of RNA-seq samples, this 
track includes 49 tissues available from the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/">Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The AbSplice score is a probability estimate of how likely aberrant splicing of some sort takes 
place in a given tissue. 
The authors <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gagneurlab/absplice?tab=readme-ov-file#output">suggest</a> 
three cutoffs which are represented by color in the track.

<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF0000">High (red)</font></b> - <b>
An AbSplice score over 0.2</b> indicates a high likelihood of aberrant splicing in at least one tissue.</li>
<li><b><font color="#FF8000">Medium (orange)</font></b> - <b>
A score between 0.05 and 0.2 </b> indicates a medium likelihood.</li>
<li><b><font color="#0000FF">Low (blue)</font></b> - <b>
A score between 0.01 and 0.05 </b> indicates a low likelihood.</li>
</ul>
Scores below 0.01 are not displayed

<p>
Mouseover on items shows the gene name, maximum score, and tissues that had this score. Clicking on 
any item brings up a table with scores for all 48 GTEX tissues.

<h2>Data Access</h2>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. 
For automated analysis, the data may be queried from our

for questions, or our

for more information.
<p>AbSplice scores are also available at the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://zenodo.org/records/10776853/files/AbSplice_DNA_hg38_snvs_high_scores.zip?download=1">public repository</a> 
created by the authors. 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Data was converted from the file
(<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10776853/files/AbSplice_DNA_hg19_snvs_high_scores.zip"
target="_blank">AbSplice_DNA_hg19_snvs_high_scores.zip</a>) provided by the authors at
<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7871809" target="_blank">zenodo.org</a>. Files in the
score_cutoff=0.01 directory were concatenated. To convert the data to bigBed format, scores and
their tissues were selected from the AbSplice_DNA fields and maximum scores, and then calculated using a
<a a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/tree/master/src/hg/makeDb/outside/abSplice/AbSplice.hg19.makedoc">
custom Python script</a>.
