<h2>Description</h2>
This track provides heatmap of multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVE) from
<a href="https://mavedb.org" target=_blank>MaveDB</a>.  Each heatmap presents the results of an
experiment where many small substitutions were tested within a gene to examine their
functional consequences.
</p><p>
<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
Heatmaps within the track display the consequence of substituting invididual amino acids within the
genome with alternatives (alternatives are listed along the left edge of the heatmap).  Score ranges
vary among experiments, but each is presented with the highest scores in
<span style="color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;">red</span>, the lowest scores in
<span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold;">blue</span>, and scores at the midpoint between the two in
<span style="color: #C0C0C0; font-weight: bold;">silver</span>.
<p>
Cells where multiple scores were reported are marked with the score count (e.g. "2" if two scores were
reported).  Mousing over a cell in the heatmap will display the ID number of that particular substitution
in the experiment, a <a href="https://www.mavedb.org/docs/mavehgvs/index.html" target=_blank>MAVE-HGVS</a>
description of the substitution, and the score (or scores, if more than one is present).
<p>
When the display is zoomed out farther than a 200,000 base window, the display switches to a coverage plot
of where the MaveDB heatmaps can be found.
</p><p>
<h4>Track Controls</h4>
The track controls include a filter for the URN ID of the experiment (e.g. 00000103-a-1).  The display supports
full, pack, and squish modes.  In dense mode, the track switches to a dense BED-like display where items mark
the extent of individual heatmaps and exons indicate where the heatmap includes score values.
</p><p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
Methods for the various experiments are described briefly on the individual details pages for each heatmap
in the track, and in greater detail on the MaveDB page for that experiment (link available on our own
details pages).
</p><p>
JSON files containing data from these experiments were processed into UCSC's heatmap extension of the
standard BED format for display here.
