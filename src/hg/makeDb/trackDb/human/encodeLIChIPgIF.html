<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide location analysis of histones H3 and H4 with antibodies
H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3ac, H4ac, STAT1, RNA polymerase II and TAF1 
was conducted with ChIP-chip, using chromatin extracted from HeLa
cells induced for 30 min with interferon-gamma as well as uninduced cells.
The H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3ac form of histone H3, and H4ac form of 
histone H4 are associated with up-regulation of gene expression.  STAT1
(signal transducer and activator of transcription) binds to DNA and activates
transcription in response to various cytokines, including interferon-gamma.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
&quot;wiggle&quot; tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from both induced and uninduced cells was separately cross-linked,
precipitated with the antibodies, sheared, amplified and hybridized
to a PCR DNA tiling array produced at the Ren Lab at UC San Diego. The array
was composed of 24,537 non-repetitive sequences within the 44 ENCODE regions.
</P>
<P>
Each state had three or more biological replicates. Each 
experiment was loess-normalized using R. The P-value and R-value were 
calculated using the modified single array error model (Li, Z. <em>et 
al</em>., 2003). The P-value and R-value were then derived from the weighted 
average results of the replicates. </P>
<P>
The displayed values were scaled to 0 - 16, corresponding to negative log base
10 of the P-value.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Each of the two experiments has three biological replicates. The
