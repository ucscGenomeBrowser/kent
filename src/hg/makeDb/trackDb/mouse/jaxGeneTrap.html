<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows gene trap sequence tags from GenBank 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/" TARGET=_BLANK>dbGSS</A>
that have an RNA-based sequence tag method (5'-RACE or 3'-RACE) or
DNA-based sequence tag method.  DNA-based gene trap sequence tags
(purple) are derived from genomic DNA at the site of gene trap vector
insertion.  RNA-based gene trap sequence tags are derived from the
exon adjacent to the insertion site. If the sequence tag method is
5'-RACE (blue), the insertion site is in the intron downstream from
the most 3' exon represented in the sequence tag. If the sequence tag
is 3'-RACE (green), the insertion site is in the intron upstream from
the most 5' exon represented in the sequence tag.
</P>
<P>
Gene trap mutagenesis requires that the vector inserts in the correct
transcriptional orientation of the &quot;trapped&quot; gene. Sequence
tags that overlap known genes in the opposite transcriptional
orientation do not disrupt those genes from a gene trapping mechanism.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Sequence tags were collected from dbGSS and aligned to the reference 
genome by 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>Mouse Genome 
Informatics (MGI)</A> at The Jackson Laboratory.</P>
