<h2>Description and display conventions</h2>

<p>
<b>NumtS</b> (Nuclear mitochondrial sequences) are mitochondrial fragments inserted 
in nuclear genomic sequences. The most credited hypothesis concerning their generation 
suggests that in the presence of mutagenic agents, or under stress conditions, fragments of 
mtDNA escape from mitochondria, reach the nucleus and insert into chromosomes during 
break repair; although NumtS can also derive from duplication of genomic fragments. 
NumtS may be a cause of contamination during mtDNA sequencing and hence frequent false 
low heteroplasmic evidences have been reported. The Bioinformatics group chaired 
by M. Attimonelli (University of Bari, Italy) has produced the RPNumtS (Reference Cow 
NumtS) compilation annotating  Cow assembled NumtS. To allow the scientific community to 
access the compilation and to perform genomics comparative analyses inclusive of the 
NumtS data, the group has designed the Cow NumtS tracks described below.
</p>

<p>
The NumtS tracks show nuclear and mitochondrial regions, based on the High Score Pairs 
(HSPs) obtained by aligning the mitochondrial reference genome (NC_006853) with the 
bosTau6 assembly of the cow genome.
</p>
 
<ol>
<li><b>"NumtS (Nuclear mitochondrial Sequences)" Track</b>
<p>
The "NumtS mitochondrial sequences" track shows the mapping of the HSPs returned by 
BlastN on the nuclear genome. The shading of the items reflect the similarity returned 
by BlastN, and the direction of the arrows is concordant with the strand of the 
alignment. For every item, a link pointing to the mitochondrial mapping is provided, 
thus allowing easier cross referencing between the NumtS subtracks.
</p>
</li>

<li><b>"NumtS assembled" Track</b>
<p>
The "NumtS assembled" track shows items obtained by assembling HSPs annotated in the 
"NumtS" track fulfilling the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>The orientation of their alignments must be concordant.</li>
<li>The distance between them must be less than 2 kb, on the mitochondrial genome 
as well as on the nuclear genome.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Exceptions for the second condition arise when a long repetitive element is present between two HSPs.
</p>
</li>
 

<li><b>"NumtS on mitochondrion" Track</b>
<p>
The "NumtS on mitochondrion" track shows the mapping of the HSPs on the mitochondrial 
genome. The shading of the items reflects the similarity returned by BlastN, and the 
direction of the arrows is concordant with the strand of the alignment. 
For every item, a link pointing to the nuclear mapping is provided.
</p>
 
<li><b>"Cow NumtS on mitochondrion SNP" Track</b>
<p>
The "Cow NumtS SNP" shows the mapping of the HSPs on the mitochondrial genome, with 
the SNPs which fall within, derived from comparison with the bosTau6 assembly. No shading is provided here.
</p>
</ol> 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
NumtS mappings were obtained by running Blast2seq (program: BlastN) between each chromosome 
of the Cow Genome (bosTau6 assembly) and the Cow mitochondrial reference sequence (AC: NC_006853), 
fixing the e-value threshold to 1e-03. The assembling of the HSPs was performed with spreadsheet 
interpolation and manual inspection. BED format is used for the first three annotation tracks, 
while for the last one the SAM/BAM format is preferred.
