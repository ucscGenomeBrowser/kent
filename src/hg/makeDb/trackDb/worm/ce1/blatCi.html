<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The Ciona genome shotgun assembly was constructed with the DOE Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) assembler, JAZZ, paired end sequencing reads at a
coverage of 8.2X produced at the JGI. The assembly contains 116.7 million base
pairs of nonrepetitive sequence in 2,501 scaffolds greater than 3 kb. Half of
this (60 Mbp) is assembled into 117 scaffolds longer than 190 Kbp; 85% of the
assembly (104.1 Mbp) is found in 905 scaffolds longer than 20 kb. Gene
modeling and analysis were performed at the JGI.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The alignments were made with blat in translated protein mode requiring
two nearby 4-mer matches to trigger a detailed alignment.  </P>
