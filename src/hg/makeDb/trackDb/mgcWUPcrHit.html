This track includes experimental sequences that splice align to the 
genomic region of the intended target structure.  Est2Genome is used for 
alignment.  Generally parameters are set such that splice_penalty=15, 
intron_penalty=30, mismatch=3, minscore=20, and gap_penalty=4.  A HIT is 
determined if the alignment has at least one splice, has an overall 
identity over 75%, at least 60% of the segments in the alignment have 
80% identity to the genome, and the terminal exons are at least length 
10.  A HIT can come from the assembled read or from either the forward 
or reverse trace.  Note that intron novelty is not a criteria for a HIT 
and that mispriming may be present.
