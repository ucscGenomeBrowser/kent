<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ChIP-chip analysis of c-Myc and E2F4 was performed using 2091 foreskin 
fibroblasts and HeLa cells. ChIP was carried out from normally-growing HeLa 
cells and from 2091 quiescent (0.1% serum FBS), as well as serum-stimulated 
(10% FBS, 4hrs), fibroblasts. 
Microarray hybridizations were performed using NimbleGen ENCODE arrays and 
protocols.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

configuration help</A> link.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from each cell line under a given condition was cross-linked with 
1% formaldehyde, sheared, precipitated with antibody, and reverse cross-linked 
to obtain enriched DNA fragments. ChIP material was amplified and hybridized 
to a NimbleGen ENCODE region array. 
The raw and processed files reflect fold enrichment over the mock ChIP sample, 
which was used as a reference in the hybridization.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Each of the four experiments has three independent biological replicates. 
Data from all three replicates were averaged to generate a single data file. 
The NimbleGen method for hit identification was used to generate the peaks at a false positive rate of &lt;= 0.05. </P>
