<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows an estimate of the binding activity of several 
transcription factors in the <em>D. melanogaster</em> blastoderm.  
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and whole-genome tiling arrays 
(ChIP/chip) were used (see Li, MacArthur <em>et al.</em>) 
to map the genomic regions bound by the 
maternally controlled transcription factors 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG1034-RA&hgg_chrom=chr3R&hgg_start=2581580&hgg_end=2585199&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>bicoid</A> 
(bcd) and 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG1759-RB&hgg_chrom=chr2L&hgg_start=20758486&hgg_end=20770602&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>caudal</A> (cad), as well as the four zygotic &quot;gap&quot; genes:
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG9786-RB&hgg_chrom=chr3R&hgg_start=4517037&hgg_end=4523540&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>hunchback</A> (hb), 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG3340-RA&hgg_chrom=chr2R&hgg_start=20734214&hgg_end=20737134&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>Kr&uuml;ppel</A> (Kr), 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG4717-RA&hgg_chrom=chr2L&hgg_start=20758486&hgg_end=20770602&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>knirps</A> (kni), and 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG7952-RB&hgg_chrom=chrX&hgg_start=2283262&hgg_end=2285119&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>giant</A> (gt),
in stage 4-5 embryos.  
The assay was also performed on an immunoglobulin G (IgG) control 
for each sample.
bcd and cad establish the anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning of the 
embryo.  The four gap genes encode transcription factors 
that work together to provide the first zygotic patterning along
the A-P axis of the embryonic trunk.
The genomic distribution of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at the
C-terminal tail has also been determined at the same stage of
development to help identify transcriptionally active genes.  
In addition, ChIP/chip was also used to map binding of the
ubiquitously expressed transcription factor 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgGene?hgg_gene=CG7803-RB&hgg_chrom=chrX&hgg_start=2283262&hgg_end=2285119&hgg_type=flyBaseGene&db=$db" TARGET=_BLANK>zeste</A> 
at a later stage of embryo development, stage 11 (Moses <em>et al.</em>). 
Enrichment factors (1 = no enrichment) are shown in separate subtracks 
for twelve antibodies at false discovery rates (FDR) of 1% and 25%.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
By default, values are displayed in grayscale (&quot;dense&quot; mode)
instead of graphing (&quot;full&quot; mode), and only six of the 24
subtracks are shown: only those with FDR of 1% and only one antibody
per factor.  To change the configuration, click on the blue or gray
button to the left of the track or click on the track title in the 
controls below the image.
</P>
<P>
The subtracks within this composite annotation track
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options for the subtracks 
are shown at the top of the track controls page, followed by a list of 
subtracks. To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to 
the tracks that you wish to hide.  
For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary. They provide a
visual cue for distinguishing between the different false discovery rates.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For bcd, hb, Kr, and kni, two antibody preparations that were
independently purified against nonoverlapping epitopes were used.
For cad, gt, PolII and z, only one set of antibodies was used.
For each purified antibody, two independent replicates of three
different sample types were analyzed on separate arrays:
<UL>
<LI> &quot;Factor immunoprecipitates (IPs)&quot; obtained by 
     immunoprecipitation using a factor-specific antibody</LI>
<LI> &quot;immunoglobulin G (IgG) control IPs&quot; obtained by 
     immunoprecipitation using a normal IgG antibody</LI>
<LI> &quot;input DNA&quot; obtained from the chromatin prior to 
     immunoprecipitation</LI>
</UL>
for a total of six arrays per antibody.

Mean hybridization intensities for transcription factor IP replicates and 
IgG control IP replicates were divided by the mean probe intensity 
in the input DNA samples to produce oligonucleotide ratio values.
The logarithms of the oligonucleotide ratios were averaged in windows of 
675 bp centered around each probe (after discarding the highest and lowest 
values, to produce a &quot;trimmed mean&quot;) to produce window scores.
Bound regions were identified by comparing window scores to expected score 
distributions computed from a symmetric null distribution.
The symmetric null method assumes that the background window 
score distribution is symmetric about its mean, and estimates the 
distribution from values less than the observed mode.  
This estimated null distribution was used to assign p-values to each 
window score, and these were corrected for multiple testing to control 
the FDR.
