<h2> Description </h2>

<DIV style='max-width: 900px'>
<p>This track displays binding sites of the specified transcription factors
in the given cell types as identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq &mdash; see Johnson DS,
<em>et al</em>., 2007 and Fields S, 2007).
</P><P>
The ChIP-seq method was used to assay chromatin fragments bound by
specific or general transcription factors as described below.  DNA isolated
by ChIP-seq was size-selected (~225 bp) and sequenced.  Short reads of
25-35 nt were mapped to the human reference genome, and enriched regions
of high read density relative to a total input chromatin control reads
were identified.
</P><P>
Included for each cell type is a control signal, which represents the control
condition where the DNA:protein crosslinks were reversed and DNA fragments
were sequenced with no immunoprecipitation (IP).
</P><P>
The sequence reads, quality scores, and alignment coordinates from
these experiments are available for download.

<h2>Track Conventions</h2>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<EM>views</EM>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that
display individually on the browser.  Instructions for configuring multi-view
tracks are  <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
The subtracks in this track are grouped by transcription factor targeted with
an antibody for ChIP and by cell type.  For each experiment (cell type vs.
antibody), the following views are included:
<DL>
<DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD>Sites with the greatest evidence of transcription
factor binding.</DD>
<DT><I>Raw Signal</I></DT><DD>A continuous signal which indicates density of
aligned reads.
The sequence reads were extended to the size-selected length (225 bp),
and the read density computed using the bedItemOverlapCount
utility.  This annotation was generated by the ENCODE Data Coordination
Center at UCSC.</DD>

<a name="Methods"></a><h2> Methods </h2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Briefly, cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibody, the
protein:DNA crosslinks were reversed and the DNA fragments were recovered
and sequenced.  Because these experiments were carried out over the course
of two years, several changes and improvements were made to the original
protocol (see Johnson DS, <em>et al</em>. 2007).  The major differences between
protocols are the number of cells and magnetic beads used for IP, the the
method of sonication used to fragment DNA, and the number of cycles of PCR
used to amplify the sequencing library.  The most current protocol used by
the Myers Lab can be found
<a href="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab/protocols"
TARGET=_blank title="http://hudsonalpha.org/myers-lab/protocols"
rel="nofollow">here</a>. The sequencing libraries labeled as PCR2x were
made with two rounds of amplification (25 and 15 cycles) and those labeled
as PCR1x were made with one 15-cycle round of amplification.  Biological
replicates from each experiment were completed.  For specific details on the
protocol used for a ChIP of interest (number of cells, DNA fragmentation and
sequencing library construction), please contact the Myers Lab at the contact
information provided below.
</P><P>
Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Genome Analyzer I or an Illumina
Genome Analyzer IIx according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Sequence
data produced by the Illumina data pipeline software were quality filtered and
then mapped to NCBI Build36 (hg18) using the integrated Eland software; 25 to
36 bp of the sequence reads were used for alignment; up to two mismatches were
tolerated; reads that mapped to multiple sites in the genome were discarded.
</P><P>
To identify likely binding sites, peak calling was applied to the aligned
sequence data sets using either Quantitative Enrichment of Sequence Tags
(<a href="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/quest" TARGET=_blank
title="http://mendel.stanford.edu/sidowlab/downloads/quest" rel="nofollow">QuEST</a>,
see Valouev A, <em>et al.</em>, 2008) or Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (
<a href="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/00README.html" TARGET=_blank
title="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/00README.html" rel="nofollow">MACS</a>,
see Zhang Y, <em>et al.</em>, 2008).  Experiments for which peak calling was completed
using MACS are labeled as "<i>softwareVersion:</i> MACS" in the list above and
can be found by clicking on the metadata link "..." for the Peaks subtrack.  Experiments
for which QuEST was used do not have a software version annotated.  QuEST is based
on the kernel density estimation approach, which uses ChIP-seq data to determine
positions where protein complexes contact DNA.  QuEST uses data in the form of
genome coordinates ('tags') obtained from mapping several million sequencing
reads to a reference genome.  Tags from forward and reverse reads cluster on
opposite sides of the transcription factor binding site.  QuEST first
constructs two separate profiles, one for forward and one for reverse tags.
QuEST identifies candidates for combined density profile (CDP) peaks as
positions in the reference genome corresponding to local maxima of the CDP with
sufficient enrichment compared to the control data.  MACS empirically models
the shift size of ChIP-seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution
of predicted binding sites.  MACS also uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to
capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions
(see Zhang Y, <em>et al.</em>, 2008).
</P>

<h2> Validation</h2>
<p>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays can be used to
validate the transcription factor binding sites found using ChIP-Seq.  Regions
of enriched read density reported by QuEST are reported as a single genomic
coordinate (peak) for each enriched region.  These peaks are ranked according
to the ChIP-Seq enrichment ratio and qPCR assays are used to validate the set
of overlapping peaks between replicates for each cell line.  qPCR primer pairs
were designed to interrogate the list of ordered peaks in common between
replicates.  Amplicons were 60-100 bp in length and were completely contained
within 250 bp of either side of the peak coordinate.  For each primer pair, qPCR
assays were performed on biological replicate ChIP samples on both cell lines
and total input chromatin DNA was recovered.  Enrichment was calculated as a
ratio of amount of target DNA over the average of a pair of negative control
primers.
An assay was considered positive when it had a two-fold or greater enrichment of
the average qPCR replicates (see Valouev A, <em>et al.</em>, 2008).

<P>
<B>Notes:</B><BR>
<a name="pA"><em>Protocol pA</em></a>: Unless otherwise noted, datasets were
generated using a protocol that involved a single round of PCR (15 cycles)
to prepare DNA fragment libraries.  Certain earlier datasets, however, were
generated using a protocol with two rounds of PCR (25 + 15 cycles).  These
datasets contain "PCR2x" in their label and metadata.  Peaks for these
experiments were called using "Input <i>(PCR2x)</i>" for background.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<P>
This is Release 3 (July 2010) of this track, which includes the revoking of a number of
data sets. In addition, experiments prviously identified as antibody Input are now
identified as RevXlinkChromatin.
