New Navigation and Display Features  </B></FONT>
		    <P>
		    We've added several new features to the Genome Browser 
		    that make it easier to quickly configure and navigate 
		    around in the browser's annotation tracks window.
		    <P>
		    <B>Automatic image resizing:</B> The first time the annotation 
		    track window is displayed, or after the Genome Browser has
		    been reset, the size of the track window is now set by 
		    default to the width that best fits your Internet browser 
		    window. If you subsequently resize your browser window, 
		    you can automatically adjust the annotation track image 
		    size to the new width by clicking the <em>resize</em> button
		    under the track image. The default width can still be 
		    manually overridden on the Track Configuration page. 
		    <P>
		    <B>Scrolling left or right in the track window:</B> You can now 
		    scroll (pan) horizontally through the tracks image by clicking 
		    on the image, dragging the cursor to the left or right, 
		    then releasing the mouse button. The view may be scrolled 
		    by up to one image width.
		    <P>
		    <B>Improved drag-zoom navigation:</B>  The browser's 
		    &quot;drag-and-zoom&quot; feature lets you quickly zoom to a
		    specific region of interest on the annotation tracks image.
		    To define the region you wish to zoom to, click-and-hold 
		    the mouse button on one edge of the desired zoom area
		    (which can be anywhere in the tracks window), depress the 
		    shift key, drag the mouse right or left to highlight the 
		    selection area, then release the mouse button.
		    The annotation tracks image will automatically zoom to
		    the new region. The Genome Browser still supports the 
		    earlier implementation of this feature, which restricted
		    the click-drag to the Base Position track area of the image,
		    but did not require the shift key to be pressed. 
		    <P>
		    <B>Reordering groups of tracks:</B> 
		    You can now vertically reposition an entire group of 
		    associated tracks in the tracks image (such as all the 
		    displayed subtracks in a composite track) by clicking and 
		    holding the gray bar to the left of the tracks,
		    dragging the group to the new position, then releasing
		    the mouse button. To move a single track up or down, click 
		    and hold the mouse button on the side label, drag the 
		    highlighted track to the new position, then release the 
		    mouse button.
		    <P>
		    If you haven't yet tried the browser's right-click 
		    menu for quick access to frequently used track 
		    configuration features and functionality, read more

New Feature: Track Data Hubs:  </B></FONT>
                    We are pleased to announce a new feature in the UCSC Genome Browser: Track Data Hubs. Track hubs are web-accessible directories of genomic data 
			that can be viewed on the UCSC Genome Browser alongside native annotation 
			tracks.
