<P>
This track displays <B>
DNaseI hypersensitivity
</B> data for the NHGRI ENCODE target regions.  DNase-I hypersensitive
sites are thought to represent nucleosome-free regions of DNA which
are bound by trans-acting factors. Treatment of nuclei with the enzyme
DNase I results in cleavage at these sites that can be detected after
running the DNA on an acrylamide gel, blotting to a membrane, and
probing with a radiolableled, complementary fragment.

The long-term goal of the NHGRI <A
HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10005107" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE Project
(ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements)</A> is to identify all functional
elements in the human genome sequence to facilitate a better
understanding of human biology and disease.

<P>
During the pilot phase, 44 regions comprising 30 Mb -- approximately
1% of the human genome -- have been selected for intensive study to
identify, locate and analyze functional elements within the
regions. These targets are being studied by a diverse public research
consortium to test and evaluate the efficacy of various methods,
technologies, and strategies for locating genomic features. The
outcome of this initial phase will form the basis for a larger-scale
effort to analyze the entire human genome.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/10506161" TARGET=_BLANK>The ENCODE
Project: Target Selection Process</A> provides a description of how
the initial target regions were selected.
