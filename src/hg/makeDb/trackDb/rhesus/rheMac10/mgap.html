<h2>Description</h2>

The Macaque Genotype and Phenotype Resource (mGAP) provides reference population-level short variant
data for rhesus macaques. The current dataset was generated from ~4,000 rhesus macaques, primarily
derived from the NIH National Primate Research Center (NPRC) colonies, although other colonies are
represented. These are outbred, genetically diverse populations.

<p>
This track contains the ~130 million high-quality short variants (SNVs and INDELs), generated from
whole genome and whole exome data. Samples were jointly called to ensure each sample was genotyped
for all loci. This track omits sample-level genotypes; however, the complete dataset with genotypes
is available to browse or download from  <a href="https://mgap.ohsu.edu/"
target="_blank">https://mgap.ohsu.edu</a>. Allele frequency and other annotations are provided.
</p>

<p>
One of the unique features of the mGAP dataset is that most samples are derived from captive
macaques housed within the NIH NPRC system. As such, these animals have lifelong health records and
usually come from a genetically validated pedigree. If a variant of interest is identified in the
mGAP dataset, it is often possible to identify specific macaques harboring that variant and
interrogate other data that exists on these animals. <a href="https://mgap.ohsu.edu/"

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Sequence reads are aligned to the Mmul10 (rheMac10) genomic assembly. Variant calling is performed
using a modified version of the Broad Institute
<a href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels"
target="_blank">GATK SNP and Indel Discovery Best Practices</a>, adapted for macaques. Raw variant
calls are subjected to fairly strict quality filtering approach, validated using Mendelian
violations and other analyses to identify regions of the macaque genome with systematic errors in
short read alignment or genotype calling.</p>

<p>
Annotation takes place in two phases. First, variants are annotated according to their predicted
consequence on protein coding. Second, a pipeline is run that maps macaque variants to the human
genome and applies a panel of annotations.
