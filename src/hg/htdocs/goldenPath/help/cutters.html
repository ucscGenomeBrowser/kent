<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows restriction enzyme recognition sites. At different browser zoom levels 
(categorized in the table below by the number of bases visible), different sets of enzymes are 
shown. &quot;Base-level&quot; refers to the browser zoom level at which individual bases are 
displayed in the Base Position track. Displays of custom enzyme sets override the table: in these 
cases, the restriction sites are consistent across all zoom levels. "Primary" enzymes are the 
canonical isoschizomer for each cutsite, usually the first isolated or most readily available. </p>
<p>
The base-level display shows the detail of the cutting pattern of the enzyme as well as the 
presence of any ambiguous or redundant nucleotides in the cutsite.  The four standard bases, G, A, 
T and C, are displayed in black, whereas non-unique bases using 
<a href="../goldenPath/help/iupac.html">IUPAC</a> designations (R, Y, N, etc) are displayed in 
blue.</p>
<p>
The term &quot;isoligamer&quot; in the enzyme details section was coined to designate enzymes that 
produce single-stranded overhanging &quot;sticky&quot; ends that are ligatable to each other. </p>
