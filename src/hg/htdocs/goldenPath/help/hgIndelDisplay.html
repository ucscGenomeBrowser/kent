				<P>
The Genome Browser offers several ways to highlight gaps in alignments
of query sequences (usually transcripts) to the genome.  Alignment
gaps result from sequence in the genome or query (or both) that cannot
be aligned, usually due to a deletion in one sequence or an insertion
in one or both sequences.  These alignment gaps frequently indicate a
problem with the query sequence or with the genome assembly.  However,
an alignment gap is not necessarily bad; for example, an mRNA
transcript might have a polyA tail that cannot be aligned to the
genome, causing an alignment gap.  The genome might have a large
&quot;insertion&quot; relative to a transcript that is simply an
intron.
				</P><P>
<B>Double horizontal line for double-sided insertion</B><BR>
A double-sided insertion occurs when both genome and query have unalignable 
sequence in the midst of alignable sequence.  When aligning transcripts to 
the genome, this usually indicates an assembly or sequencing error.  
Double-sided insertions may optionally be drawn with two parallel horizontal 
lines instead of the usual single horizontal line that implies an intron.
				</P><P>
<B>Query insertion coloring</B><BR>
An insertion in the query only may indicate a sequencing error in the
query, an assembly error in the genome, or a polymorphism.  Such
insertions may optionally be visually highlighted by a colored
vertical line: orange for an insertion in the middle of the query,
implying extra bases in the transcript sequence or missing bases in
the genome sequence; and blue for an insertion at the beginning or end
of a query, implying a partial alignment of the query.
				</P><P>
<B>Valid poly-A tail coloring</B><BR>
If the Genome Browser has access to the query sequence, it offers the option 
of drawing a vertical green line when a query insertion at the beginning or 
end of a sequence happens to represent a poly-A tail.  
When viewing large regions of the genome that contain many alignments,
this option may slow down the display a bit, comparable to the 
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoringMrna.html">base coloring options</A>,
due to the time it takes to retrieve and examine query sequences.
				</P><P>

When zoomed out to very large regions of the genome, each pixel column
of the Genome Browser image represents many pixels -- sometimes so
many that an entire transcript may fall into a single pixel column.
If that transcript has several types of alignment difference to
display in one pixel column, then only one can appear, overriding the others.  
The priority of display, from most important to least important, is 
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>If <A HREF="/goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoringMrna.html">coloring of 
differences</A> is enabled, a difference between query sequence 
and genome sequence (red).</LI>
<LI>An insertion in the query only (orange or blue).</LI>
<LI>An insertion in both genome and query (double horizontal line).</LI>
<LI>A valid poly-A tail (green).</LI>
</UL>
