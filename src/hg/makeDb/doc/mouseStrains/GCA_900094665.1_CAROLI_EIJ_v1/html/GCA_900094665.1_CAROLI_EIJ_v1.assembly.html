<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the sequences used in the 11 Jan 2017 <em>Mus caroli </em>/GCA_900094665.1_CAROLI_EIJ_v1 genome assembly.

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the
currently viewed scaffold.
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</p>
<p>
This assembly has 27,784 component parts, with the following principal types of parts:
<ul>
<li>W - whole genome shotgun (count: 27,784)</li>
</ul></p>
