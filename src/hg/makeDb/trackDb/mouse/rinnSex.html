<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows gene expression differences between adult male 
and female tissues, as described in Rinn <em>et al.</em>, 2004. 
<p>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
In full display mode, the medians of all replicates (technical and biological)
for each sex's tissue are shown. To view the individual replicates, use the 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgNear">UCSC Gene Sorter</A>. In packed and squished 
display modes, the average over all tissues is shown for each sex. Dense 
display mode shows the placement of the Affy MOE430A target sequences 
colored by overall expression level in both sexes, with darker colors 
representing higher levels of expression.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Five adult mouse tissues (liver, kidney, hypothalamus, ovary and testis) 
were studied. For each somatic tissue, triple selected poly-A mRNA was 
prepared from six independent pools (biological replicates), three male and 
three female.  Likewise, three pools were prepared from the ovary and three 
pools from the testis. Each pool of RNA was derived from ten individuals. 
For each biological replicate, two cDNAs (technical replicates) 
were prepared and independently hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A chips.</P>
