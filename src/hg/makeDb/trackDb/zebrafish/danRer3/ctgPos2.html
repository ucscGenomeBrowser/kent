<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the May 2005 
$organism Zv5 assembly from <A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/zebrafish/genomeproject.html"
TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
Following the assembly of sequence to WGS contigs, contigs were mapped to 
scaffolds (supercontigs). A fingerprinted contigs (FPC) map was produced by 
restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII. Clones were selected from this for 
high quality sequencing. To create the Zv5 assembly, the scaffolds were tied 
to this FPC map. The chrFinished scaffolds from the Zv3 assembly (danRer1) have been placed on chromosomes since the Zv4 assembly (danRer2).
</P>
<P>
The assembly contains 16,214 scaffolds having an N50 length of 1,117 kb. Of 
these, a total of 14,941 scaffolds are in the unordered chromosomes: 
265 in chrUn, and 14,676 in chrNA.

The Zv5 Zebrafish assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, 
the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory),
and Yi Zhou, Anthony DiBiase and Leonard Zon from the Boston Children's 
Hospital.
