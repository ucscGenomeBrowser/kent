Adjusted nucleosome coverage (from 25 bp portion of the reads)
The plot represents relative mononucleosome enrichment at each 
position in the genome (on a log of 2 scale). The coverage metric is 
given according to a formula [ (1+n)/N ] / [ (1+c)/C ] where n and c 
are the numbers of putative 147 bp cores covering each bp from 
nucleosome and control data, N and C are the total number of 
nucleosome and control reads obtained by SOLiD sequencing with 25bps 
mapped to the reference genome.
