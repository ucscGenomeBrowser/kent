<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows known protein-coding genes from organisms other than 
$organism, taken from the NCBI mRNA reference sequences collection (RefSeq).

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This track follows the display conventions for 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#GeneDisplay">gene prediction 
tracks</A>.
The color shading indicates the level of review the RefSeq record has 
undergone: predicted (light), provisional (medium), reviewed (dark).</P>
<P>
The item labels and display colors of features within this track can be
configured through the controls at the top of the track description page. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Label:</B> By default, items are labeled by gene name. Click the 
appropriate Label option to display the accession name instead of the gene
name, show both the gene and accession names, or turn off the label 
completely.
<LI><B>Codon coloring:</B> This track contains an optional codon coloring 
feature that allows users to quickly validate and compare gene predictions.
To display codon colors, select the <em>genomic codons</em> option from the
<em>Color track by codons</em> pull-down menu. Click 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgCodonColoring.html">here</A> for more 
information about this feature.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The mRNAs were aligned against the $organism genome using blat; those with an 
alignment of less than 15% were discarded. At least 40 bases must be aligned 
to DNA that is not repeat masked. When a single mRNA aligned in multiple places, 
the alignment having the highest base identity was identified. Only alignments 
having a base identity level within 1.0% of the best and at least 35% base 
identity with the genomic sequence were kept.
