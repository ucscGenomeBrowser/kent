<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track shows DNaseI sensitivity measured genome-wide using the Digital DNaseI methodology (see below), and DNaseI hypersensitive sites.  DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and DNaseI hypersensitivity is a universal feature of active <EM>cis</EM>-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led to the discovery of functional regulatory elements that include enhancers, insulators, promotors, locus control regions and novel elements.</P>

<P>DNaseI-treated chromatin samples from the following cell types were studied:

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>DNaseI sensitivity is shown as the absolute density of <EM>in vivo</EM> cleavage sites across the genome mapped using the Digital DNasI methodology (see below).  Data have been normalized to 25 million reads per cell type.  DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) at False Discovery Rate (FDR) 0.5% are shown within each density track as colored red subregions.</P>
 
<P>The subtracks within this composite annotation track correspond to data from different cell types and tissues.  The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks. To display only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide. For more information about the graphical configuration options, click the <A HREF="http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html">Graph configuration help</A> link.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>Digital DNaseI was performed by performing DNaseI digestion of intact nuclei, isolating DNaseI 'double-hit' fragments as described in Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> (2006), and direct sequencing of fragment ends (which correspond to <EM>in vivo</EM> DNaseI cleavage sites) using the Solexa platform (27 bp reads).  Uniquely mapping high-quality reads were mapped to the genome.  DNaseI sensitivity is directly reflected in raw tag density, which is shown in the track as density of tags mapping within a 150 bp sliding window (at a 20 bp step across the genome).  DNaseI hypersensitive zones were identified using the HotSpot algorithm described in Sabo <EM>et al.</EM> (2004).  0.5% false discovery rate thresholds (FDR 0.005) were computed for each cell type by applying the HotSpot algorithm to an equivalent number of random uniquely mapping 27mers.  DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) were identified as signal peaks within FDR 0.5% hypersensitive zones using a peak-finding algorithm.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>Data were verified by sequencing biological replicates displaying correlation coefficient >0.9.  Results are extensively validated by conventional DNaseI hypersensitivity assays using end-labeling/Southern blotting method. </P>

<H2>Credits</H2>
