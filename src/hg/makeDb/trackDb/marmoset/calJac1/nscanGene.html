<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track shows gene predictions using the N-SCAN gene structure prediction
software provided by the Computational Genomics Lab at Washington University 
in St. Louis, MO, USA.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<H3>N-SCAN PASA-EST</H3>
<P>
N-SCAN combines biological-signal modeling in the target genome sequence along
with information from a multiple-genome alignment to generate <em>de novo</em> gene
predictions. It extends the TWINSCAN target-informant genome pair to allow for
an arbitrary number of informant sequences as well as richer models of
sequence evolution. N-SCAN models the phylogenetic relationships between the
aligned genome sequences, context-dependent substitution rates, insertions,
and deletions.
</P>
<P>
For creating predictions on marmoset, N-SCAN uses mouse (mm9) as the informant.
</P>
<P>
N-SCAN PASA-EST combines EST alignments into N-SCAN. Similar to the conservation
sequence models in TWINSCAN, separate probability models are developed for EST
alignments to genomic sequence in exons, introns, splice sites and UTRs,
reflecting the EST alignment patterns in these regions. N-SCAN PASA-EST is more
accurate than N-SCAN while retaining the ability to discover novel genes to
which no ESTs align.
</P>

<P>
Due to the availability of only a small number of marmoset cDNA sequences, EST
sequence evidence was created using UCSC's liftOver program to map
PASA-clustered ESTs from human (hg18) to the calJac1 genome.
See the description of N-SCAN PASA-EST under hg18 for more details.
</P>
<P>
No manual annotation was performed to generate any of the gene models. The
high accuracy of the set is in part due to the large number of available human ESTs
and full length cDNAs.
