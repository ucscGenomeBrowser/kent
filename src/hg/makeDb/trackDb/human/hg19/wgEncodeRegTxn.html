<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows transcription levels for several cell types as assayed by high throughput
sequencing of polyadenylated RNA (RNA-seq).
Additional views of this dataset and additional documentation on the methods used
for this track are available at the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeCaltechRnaSeq>ENCODE Caltech RNA-seq</A> page.  The data
shown here is derived from the <i>Raw Signal</i> view from the paired 75-mer 200 bp insert size reads.  The two replicates of the signal were pooled, and normalized so that the total signal genome
wide sums to 10 billion.
</p>
<H2>Display conventions</H2>
<p>By default this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell 
lines in the same vertical space.  Each of the cell lines in this track is associated with a particular
color, and these cell line colors are consistent across all tracks that are part of the
<A HREF=../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeReg>ENCODE Regulation</a> supertrack.
These colors are relatively light and saturated so as to work best with the transparent overlay.  
Unfortunately, outside the ENCODE Regulation tracks, older cell line
color conventions are used that don't match the cell line colors used in
the ENCODE Regulation tracks. The older colors were not used in the
ENCODE Regulation tracks because they were too dark for the transparent
overlay.

<H2> Data Release Policy </H2>
<P>Data users may freely use ENCODE data, but may not, without prior
consent, submit publications that use an unpublished ENCODE dataset until
nine months following the release of the dataset.  This date is listed in
the <EM>Restricted Until</EM> column, above.  The full data release policy
for ENCODE is available
