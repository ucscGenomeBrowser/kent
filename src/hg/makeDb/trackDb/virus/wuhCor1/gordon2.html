<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
<p>This track shows data from Gordon et al, 2020 <a target=_blank href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.002386v1.full.pdf+html">"A
SARS-CoV-2-Human Protein-Protein Interaction Map Reveals Drug Targets and
Potential Drug-Repurposing"</a>.

<p>The authors cloned, tagged and expressed 26
of the mature proteins expressed by SARS-CoV-2 in 293 human cells and used
affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to identify human proteins that
interact with viral proteins. 332 high confidence interactions are reported
betwen human and viral proteins. 

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p> 
<p>On the viral genome the coordinates of the viral protein are marked and labeled with the name of the human interactor. 
<p>The bed file also includes the <a target=_blank href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378866/">MIST</a> score * 1000.  A MIST score of 1 is a highly reproducible and specific interaction, scores are multipled by 1000 for display purposes.
<p>The set of interactions displayed hered includes *only* the 332 "high confidence" interactions that met criteria for significance (using a MIST cutoff >= 0.7 as well as "a SAINTexpress BFDR <= 0.05 and an average spectral count &gt;= 2."). 

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The tab delimited version of supplementary table 2 was downloaded from <a target=_blank href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/22/2020.03.22.002386/DC5/embed/media-5.xlsx?download=true"> biorxiv</a>.
This table lists the viral protein that served as the "bait" and Uniprot identifiers of human proteins that were captured as "prey".</p>
<p>We then manually modified a version of the "UniProt Mature Protein Products (Polypeptide Chains)" track to rename ORFs to match paper nomenclature as indicated by Figure 1.</p>
<p>The table was then joined and MIST score multipled by 1000 to produce a track reporting interactions. </p>
