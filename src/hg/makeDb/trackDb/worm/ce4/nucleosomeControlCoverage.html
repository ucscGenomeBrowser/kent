<H3>Micrococcal nuclease control coverage, sense strand reads</H3>

<P>
Micrococcal nuclease control coverage plot: sense strand reads
The plot represents local coverage by control micrococcal nuclease 
fragments from cleavage of naked C. elegans DNA.  By analogy with the 
experimental nucleosome data, 147 bp sense segments starting from 
each of the individual  control reads has been used to assemble a  
control coverage plot that accounts for enzymatic and sequencing 
biases of sampling from the reference genome.

<P>
Micrococcal nuclease control coverage plot: antisense strand reads
The plot represents local coverage by control micrococcal nuclease 
fragments from cleavage of naked C. elegans DNA.  By analogy with the 
experimental nucleosome data, 147 bp antisense segments starting from 
each of the individual  control reads has been used to assemble a  
control coverage plot that accounts for enzymatic and sequencing 
biases of sampling from the reference genome.
