<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows conserved mammalian microRNA regulatory target sites
for conserved microRNA families in
the 3' UTR regions of Refseq Genes, as predicted by TargetScanMouse 5.1. </P> 

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
Putative miRNA binding sites in UTRs were identified using seven-nucleotide
seed regions from all known miRNA families conserved across mammals.
Using all mouse RefSeq transcripts and CDS annotation from NCBI,
aligned vertebrate 3' UTRs were extracted from multiz alignments and masked
for overlap with protein-coding sequences.
These 3' UTRs were scanned to identify conserved matches to the miRNA seed
region, as in Friedman <EM>et al</EM>. (2009).
These sites were then assigned a percentile rank (0 to 100) based on their
context score (Grimson <EM>et al</EM>., 2007).
