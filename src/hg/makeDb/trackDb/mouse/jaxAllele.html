<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows 
<A HREF="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" TARGET=_BLANK>Mouse Genome 
Informatics (MGI)</A>
representative transcripts associated with 
MGI-curated alleles.  Items are named by concatenating the
representative transcript ID and allele symbol. 
All chemical- and radiation-induced alleles have been
combined as type &quot;Induced.&quot; 
Floxed/Frt, reporter, knock-out and knock-in
targeted alleles are combined as type &quot;Targeted.&quot; 
Random-expressed, random-gene
disruption, and Cre/Flp transgenes are combined as
type &quot;Transgenic&quot;. 
The other types included in this track are &quot;GeneTrapped&quot;, 
&quot;Spontaneous&quot; and &quot;Other&quot;.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The MGI database report MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt was parsed to provide a
list of all curated alleles that have associated representative 
transcripts.</P>
