<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project.
This track displays transcriptional fragments associated with RNA binding proteins in different
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>,
using RIP-Chip (Ribonomic) profiling on Affymetrix GeneChip ENCODE 2.0R Tiling Arrays.
The <i>RBP Assoc RNA</i> view shows the genomic location of transcripts
associated with the array probes.
Data for this track was produced as part of the
<A TARGET="_BLANK" HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>.

</P>


<P>In eukaryotic organisms, gene regulatory networks require an additional
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However,
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns.
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Chip profiling.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>This track is a multi-view composite track. For each view there
are multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines.
This track is initially released with a single view:
</P>
<DL>
<DT><i>RBP Assoc RNA</i>
<DD>The RBP Assoc RNA view shows the genomic extent of the transcriptional segments
associated with the Affymetrix Tiling Array probes.
</DL>
Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are

<A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell">ENCODE cell culture protocols </A>.
The associated transcriptional fragments were identified using Affymetrix GeneChip ENCODE 2.0R Tiling Arrays.
Arrays were analyzed using Affymetrix Tiling Analysis Software (TAS) version 1.1.
</P>
<P>
Total Input and T7Tag (negative control)
tracks were each developed by single sample analysis of their respective triplicate sets with quantile normalization and linear
scaling applied.  Probe signals were calculated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator with a bandwidth of 100 bases.
Resulting signal files were examined to develop percentiles.  Interval analysis was performed using a minimum cut-off
equal to the 95th percentile signal score, a minimum run of 21 (3 * platform resolution) and max gap of 63 (9 * platform resolution).
</P>
<P>
Treatment RIP tracks (e.g., ELAVL1, PABC1) were developed by two sample analysis with T7Tag used as
the control.  Quantile normalization and scaling was applied to these sample groups individually.
Probe signals were calculated with the Hodges-Lehmann estimator using signal log (log2) ratios and a bandwidth of 100 bases.
Resulting signal files were examined to develop percentiles.  Interval analysis was performed using a minimum cut-off
equal to the 95th percentile signal ratio score, a minimum run of 21 (3 * platform resolution) and max gap of 63 (9 * platform resolution).
