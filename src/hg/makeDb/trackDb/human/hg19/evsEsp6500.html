<H2>Description</H2>

<P>The goal of the 
<A HREF="https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/" target=_blank>NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)</A> 
is to discover novel genes and mechanisms contributing to heart, lung and blood disorders by 
pioneering the application of next-generation sequencing of the protein coding regions of the 
human genome across diverse, richly-phenotyped populations and to share these datasets and 
findings with the scientific community to extend and enrich the diagnosis, management and 
treatment of heart, lung and blood disorders. The current data release (ESP6500SI-V2-SSA137) 
through the 
<A HREF="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/#tabs-7" target=_blank>EVS website</A> 
is taken from 6,503 samples drawn from multiple 
<A HREF="https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/dbGaP_Releases" target=_blank>ESP cohorts</A> 
and represents all of the ESP exome variant data.

<P>
Data in this track were obtained from the  
<A HREF="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/#tabs-7" target=_blank>EVS Release Version: v.0.0.25. (Feb. 7, 2014)</A>.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
In &quot;dense&quot; mode, a vertical line is drawn at the position of each
variant.
In &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;full&quot; modes, in addition to the vertical line, a label to 
the left shows the reference allele first and variant alleles below 
(<span style='color:red;'>A = red</span>, <span style='color:blue;'>C = blue</span>, 
<span style='color:green;'>G = green</span>, <span style='color:magenta;'>T = magenta</span>, 
Indels = black).
Hovering the pointer over any variant will prompt the display of the occurrences numbers for each
allele in the Exome Sequencing Project's database.  Clicking on any variant will result in 
full details of that variant being displayed as well as possible links to the ESP and dbSNP 
databases.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>Sequences were aligned to NCBI build 37 human genome reference using BWA. PCR duplicates 
were removed using Picard. Alignments were recalibrated using GATK. Lane-level indel realignments 
and base alignment quality (BAQ) adjustments were applied.
</P>
<P>
All data were simultaneously analyzed for exome SNP variants at the University of Michigan 
(by the Abecasis Laboratory). SNPs were called using a two-step approach. First, genotype 
likelihood files (GLFs) were generated using samtools pileup on individual BAM files. Next, 
we used glfMultiples, a multi-sample variant caller, to generate initial SNP calls. Details of
the likelihood model implemented in glfMultiples are given in Li, <em>et al</em>., 2011
(in the section entitled "Identifying Potential Polymorphic Sites"). The Michigan SNP calling pipeline
is available at: 
<A HREF="http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/UMAKE" target=_blank>http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/UMAKE</A>. 
This pipeline makes diploid calls for pseudo-autosomal regions of male samples and haploid 
calls for the rest of the chromosome. Female samples have diploid calls for all regions on 
the X chromosome. SNPs were filtered by a machine-learning technique called support 
vector machine (SVM) classification (for a detailed description, see 
<A HREF="http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/HelpDescriptions.jsp?tab=tabs-1#FilterStatus" target=_blank>Filter Status</A>).
</P>

<P>Small INDEL variants were analyzed at the Broad Institute (by the Genome Sequencing and 
Analysis group) using the 
<A HREF="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/" target=_blank>GATK</A> 
variation discovery pipeline following the guidelines in the 
<A HREF="http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/discussion/1186/best-practice-variant-detection-with-the-gatk-v4-for-release-2-0" target=_blank>GATK best practices v4</A>. 
More specifically, each BAM was reduced to create a Reduced BAM, and then INDELs were 
discovered by analyzing all samples simultaneously with the GATK 
<A HREF="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_genotyper_UnifiedGenotyper.html"
target=_blank>UnifiedGenotyper</A>,
and subsequently filtered by the GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) filtering 
model, again following the V4 best practices. The INDEL genotypes for X and Y chromosomes
were adjusted to be consistent with the samples' genders. Female samples have diploid calls 
for all regions on the X chromosome. Male samples have diploid calls for pseudo-autosomal 
regions on the X chromosome and haploid calls for the rest of the X chromosome and on the 
Y chromosome as well. However, the INDEL calls for the ESP data are preliminary and not as 
robust as the SNP calls at this point. Users are advised to keep this difference in mind 
when applying the ESP data to research studies.
</P>
<P>All SNPs and INDELs were further annotated by 
<A HREF="http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation137/" target=_blank>SeattleSeqAnnotation137</A>, 
and the variant annotations at the coding-DNA and protein levels mostly follow 
<A HREF="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/" target=_blank>HGVS</A> 
notations.
</P>
<P>The SNP calls are included in the release of dbSNP build 138. The full dataset is described in
Fu, <em>et al</em>., 2013, and a subset of the data (i.e., 2,500 exomes) was published by the ESP Population
Genetics and Statistical Analysis Working Group in Tennessen, <em>et al</em>., 2012.
