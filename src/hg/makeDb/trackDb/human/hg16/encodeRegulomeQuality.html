<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track provides a visual representation of data quality scores, which range
from 0 to 1, for each plate in the UW/Regulome experiments. 
It is one of a set of tracks that annotate continuous DNaseI 
sensitivity measurements and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) over ENCODE 
regions. 
DNaseI has long been used to map general chromatin accessibility and the 
DNaseI &quot;hyperaccessibility&quot; or &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; that is a 
universal feature of active <em>cis</em>-regulatory sequences.
The data were produced using quantitative chromatin profiling (QCP) 
(Dorschner <em>et al.</em>, 2004). </P>
<P>
Quality scores are available on the following cell lines/phenotypes and 
chromosomes:

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Plates with scores 
greater than or equal to 0.5 were conservatively considered acceptable for 
reliable scoring of HSs.  Scores are shown in greyscale, with darker colors 
indicating higher scores.</P>
<P>
This composite annotation track consists of several subtracks that 
show the quality scores for each cell line/phenotype. 
To show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks 
you wish to hide. The display may also be filtered to show only those items 
with unnormalized scores that meet or exceed a certain threshhold. To set a 
threshhold, type the minimum score into the text box at the top of the 
description page.</P>
<P>
Color differences among the subtracks are arbitrary; they provide a
visual cue for distinguishing the different cell lines/phenotypes.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
QCP was performed as described in Dorschner <em>et al</em>. See the UW/Reg
Amplicon track description for more information.
QCP assays were formatted into 384-well plates for high-throughput real-time 
PCR.  Each plate was treated as a separate experiment.  
<P>
Plate quality scores were computed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
Trained operators manually scored 500 plates, classifying each on a scale of 
1 to 5 to rank the degree of experimental noise.  The unified set was then used 
to train an SVM to classify and score &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; 
plates.  Good plates were conservatively assigned noise scores of 1 - 3;
bad plates received scores of 4 - 5.  By performing cross validation on a 90% 
subsample of the training set, the SVM achieved an ROC (receiver
operating characteristic) score of 0.93.</P>
