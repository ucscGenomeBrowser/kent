<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of $organism contigs on the physical map. 
The underlying data is derived from the GRCh37 <em>AGP</em> file 
that accompanies this assembly. 
The contigs in this track are identical to those in the
<a href="hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=ctgPos2" target="_blank">
GRC Map Contigs</a> track, 
the difference being the the contigs in the GRC Map Contigs 
track are named according to GRC.
All contigs in this track are oriented to the 
&quot;+&quot; strand.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
For $organism genome reference sequences dated April 2003 and later,
the individual chromosome sequencing centers are responsible
for preparing the assembly of their chromosomes in 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/datorg.html">AGP</A> format
(see also: <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification.shtml"
TARGET="_blank">AGP File Specification</A>).
The files provided by these centers are checked and validated at NCBI, and
form the basis for the <em>AGP</em> file that defines the physical 
map contigs.</P>
