<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of P and Minos transposable element insertions
from the 
<A HREF="http://flypush.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu/pscreen/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Gene Disruption Project</A>,
the ongoing collaboration of the Bellen, Hoskins and Spradling 
labs that began as the 
<A HREF="http://www.fruitfly.org/p_disrupt/index.html" TARGET=_BLANK>
BDGP Gene Disruption Project</A>.
<P>
Triangular arrows indicate the approximate positions in the reference
sequence at which P or Minos elements have been inserted.  
The direction of the arrow corresponds to the orientation of the
insertion: right-pointing arrows indicate forward orientation;
left-pointing arrows show reverse orientation.  
The item name indicates the strain that has a P or Minos insertion at
that location.  
When a stock order number is available for the strain, a link is
provided to the Bloomington stock center where the strain can be
ordered.  The project's strain library contains more than 7670 strains
disrupting at least 5359 genes annotated by FlyBase.  This track omits
several strains whose insertion coordinates are not yet known.
