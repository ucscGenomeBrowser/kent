<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows TAF1 binding in fibroblastoid
(IMR90) cells as assayed by ChIP-chip using a NimbleGen microarray.  
The companion <em>LI TAF Sites</em> track shows binding sites derived from
these experiments.
<P>
TAF1, a protein found at the start of transcribed genes, is a general 
transcription factor that is a key part of the pre-initiation complex found 
on the promoter.  It is more fully known as TBP-associated factor 1 of the 
TFIID complex or by its molecular weight as TAF250.</P>
<P>
To survey the entire human genome in an unbiased fashion, a
total of 38 high-density oligonucleotide arrays (NimbleGen platform)
were fabricated, representing approximately 1.45 billion base pairs of
non-repetitive DNA with 50-mer oligonucleotides positioned at every 100
base pairs throughout the human genome (UCSC hg16). Using this array,
genome-wide location analysis of TAF1 was conducted employing ChIP-chip using
chromatin extracted from primary fibroblast IMR90 cells.  

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from IMR90 cells lines was cross-linked, precipitated with
TAF1 antibody (sc-735, Santa Cruz), sheared, amplified and hybridized
to 38 high-density oligonucleotide arrays (NimbleGen). These arrays
contain a total of 14,535,659 50-mer oligonucleotides positioned at
every 100 base pairs through the human genome (UCSC hg16).

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The peaks from genome scan experiments were verified using condensed
arrays, as described in the Methods section.
The verification data may be viewed in the <em>LI TAF1 Valid </em>track.
