<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the draft assembly (Feb. 2010, ISGC (NCBI project 10703, accession GCA_000005525.1))
of the $organism genome.

Many of these gaps &mdash; with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps &mdash; may be closed during the
finishing process.

<P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is supported by read pair data, 
it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>fragment</B> - gap between sequence contigs.
<LI><B>clone</B> - gap between clones that do not overlap.
    In general, these are usually represented by 5,000 <em>N</em>s
        in the assembly.
<LI><B>other</B> - unknown bases marked 'N' in the sequence that were not
        in the assembly AGP file definition of gaps.
</UL>
