<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Transcriptome Project. 
It shows the starts and ends of DNA fragments from different 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell
lines</A>
determined by paired-end ditag (PET) sequencing using different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=fragSize">DNA
fragment sizes</A> 
for analysis of genome structural variation. 
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>

<P>In the graphical display, the ends are represented by blocks connected by a 
horizontal line. In full and packed display modes, the arrowheads on the 
horizontal line represent the strand, and an ID of the 
format <EM>XXXXX-N-M</EM> is shown to the left of each PET, where <EM>X</EM> 
is the unique ID for each PET, <EM>N</EM> indicates the number of mapping 
locations in the genome (1 for a single mapping location, 2 for two mapping 
locations, and so forth), and <EM>M</EM> is the number of PET sequences at 
this location. PETs that mapped to multiple locations may represent low 
complexity or repetitive sequences.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Sample genomic DNA was isolated, hydrosheared at a given size-range, then
ligated with specific DNA linker sequence at both ends, followed by
gel-selection of the desired size, e.g., 1 kb, 10 kb, etc. respectively. 
The DNA fragments modified with linker at both ends (e.g., 10 kb) were then
circularized by ligation, followed by restriction digest with enzyme EcoP15I to
generate DNA-PETs (25-bp tag from each end).  The PETs were ligated with SOLiD
sequencing adaptors at both ends, then amplified by PCR and purified as complex
templates for high throughput DNA sequencing. The current DNA-PET data sets
submitted are mostly generated by SOLiD platform. 
Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture
protocols</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Data:</B>
Reads of DNA-PETs were mapped onto reference genome, NCBI Build36, hg18. 
A majority of the PETs mapped on the same chromosome in correct orientations and
within expected distance span (e.g., a 10 kb DNA-PET was expected mapping on ~10
kb span distance).  A small portion of misaligned PETs, called discordant PETs,
mapped either too far from each other, had wrong orientations, or in different
chromosomes indicating various genome structure or variations observed between
the sample and the reference genome. The variations could be due to deletion,
inversion, tandem repeats, trans-location, fusion etc.
</P>
<P><B>Mapping parameters:</B>
Mapping was done using Applied Biosystems' SOLiD alignment and pairing pipeline.
Initial mapping was done allowing two mismatches in color space and recovery
was performed during pairing that allowed up to 4 mismatches in a pair.
</P> 

<H2>Verification</H2>
Representative structural variations identified by DNA-PET data have been 
verified by targeted PCR and sequencing analysis to confirm the predicted 
rearrangement sites.  Some of them have also been validated by FISH.

<H2>Credits</H2>

<P>The GIS-DNA PET libraries and sequence data for genome structural 
variation analysis were produced at the 
<A HREF="http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site" TARGET=_BLANK>Genome Institute of
Singapore</A>. 
The data were mapped and analyzed by scientists Xiaoan Ruan, Atif Shahab, 
Chialin Wei, and Yijun Ruan at the Genome Institute of Singapore.
