<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
These tracks display the locations of active regulatory elements identified as 
open chromatin in  <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">multiple cell types</A>
from the Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, UT-Austin, and EBI ENCODE group.
Within this project, open chromatin was identified using two 
independent and complementary methods: DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS) 
and Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), 
combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for select 
regulatory factors. DNaseI HS and FAIRE provide assay 
cross-validation with commonly identified regions delineating the 
highest confidence areas of open chromatin.  ChIP assays provide 
functional validation and preliminary annotation of a subset of 
open chromatin sites. Each method employed Illumina (formerly Solexa) 
sequencing by synthesis as the detection platform.  
The Tier 1 and Tier 2 cell types were additional verified by a
second platform, high-resolution 1% ENCODE tiled microarrays supplied by NimbleGen. 
</P>
<P>
The particular tracks described in this page detail results from the FAIRE experiments. 
Data for the DNaseI HS experiments can be found in the <B>ENC DNase/FAIRE Super-track</B> 
in the <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">
Duke DNaseI HS track</A>.  Data for the ChIP experiments can be found 
<B>ENC TF Binding Super-track</B> in the <A TARGET=_BLANK
HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">
UTA TBFS track</A>. 
</P>
<P>
<B>DNaseI HS data</B>: DNaseI is an enzyme that has long been used to map general
chromatin accessibility, and DNaseI "hypersensitivity" is a feature of active
cis-regulatory sequences.The use of this method has led to the discovery of 
functional regulatory elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers, 
insulators, locus control regions, and novel elements. DNaseI hypersensitivity 
signifies chromatin accessibility following binding of trans-acting factors in 
place of a canonical nucleosome.</P>
<P>
<B>FAIRE data</B>: FAIRE (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory
Elements) is a method to isolate and identify nucleosome-depleted regions of
the genome.  FAIRE was initially discovered in yeast and subsequently shown to
identify active regulatory elements in human cells (Giresi <em>et al.</em>,
2007).Similar to DNaseI HS, FAIRE appears to identify functional regulatory 
elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, locus 
control regions and novel elements.</P>
<P>
<B> ChIP data</B>: ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) is a method to 
identify the specific location of proteins that are directly or indirectly 
bound to genomic DNA. By identifying the binding location of sequence-specific 
transcription factors, general transcription machinery components, and 
chromatin factors, ChIP can help in the functional annotation of the open 
chromatin regions identified by DNaseI HS mapping and FAIRE.</P>
<P>
<B>Input data</B>: As a background control experiment, we sequenced 
the input genomic DNA sample that was used for ChIP. Crosslinked chromatin 
is sheared and the crosslinks are reversed without carrying out the 
immunoprecipitation step. This sample is otherwise processed in a manner 
identical to the ChIP sample as described below. The input track is 
useful in revealing potential artifacts arising from the sequence 
alignment process such as copy number differences between the 
reference genome and the sequenced samples, as well as regions of 
poor sequence alignability.</P> 
    

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains a single data type 
with multiple levels of annotation (views). For each view, there are 
multiple subtracks representing different cell types that display individually on the browser. 
Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <A HREF="../../goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
Chromatin data displayed here represents a continuum of signal intensities. 
The Crawford lab recommends setting the &quot;Data view scaling: <EM>auto-scale</EM>&quot;
option when viewing signal data in full mode to see the <EM>full</EM> dynamic range of the data. 
Note that in regions that do not have open chromatin sites, autoscale will rescale the data 
and inflate the background signal, making the regions appear noisy.  Changing back to fixed 
scale will alleviate this issue. In general, for each experiment in each of the cell types, 
the UNC FAIRE tracks contain the following views: 
<P><DT><I>Peaks</I></DT><DD>Regions of enriched signal in FAIRE experiments. 
Peaks were called based on signals created using F-Seq, a software program developed 
at Duke (Boyle <em>et al.</em>, 2008b). Significant regions were determined 
by fitting the data to a gamma distribution to calculate p-values.  
Contiguous regions where p-values were below a 0.05/0.01 threshold were 
considered significant.  The solid vertical line in the peak represents the 
point with highest signal.</DD> 
</P>
<P><DT><I>Peaks (Zinba)</I></DT><DD> Enriched regions for FAIRE data were called
using ZINBA (Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Algorithm). ZINBA is a flexible
statistical method that uses a generalized linear model to select genomic
windows with enriched sequence counts after adjusting for relevant confounding
factors such as mapability, GC content, and copy number alterations.
Significant regions are selected using the set of standardized residuals
below a false discovery rate (qvalue) threshold. Peaks were further refined
using a shape detection algorithm to identify local maxima and boundaries of
the Raw Base Overlap Signal data within each significant region.</DD>
</P>
<P><DT><I>F-Seq Density Signal</I></DT><DD> Density graph (wiggle) of signal
enrichment calculated using F-Seq for the combined set of sequences from all
replicates. F-Seq employs Parzen kernel density estimation to create base pair
scores (Boyle <em>et al.</em>, 2008b). This method does not look at fixed-length
windows but rather weights contributions of nearby sequences in proportion to
their distance from that base.  It only considers sequences aligned 4 or less
times in the genome, and uses an alignability background model to try to correct
for regions where sequences cannot be aligned. For each cell type, especially 
important for those with an abnormal karyotype, a model to try to correct for 
amplifications and deletions that is based on control input data was also used. </DD>
</P>
<P><DT><I>Raw Base Overlap Signal</I></DT><DD> An alternative version of the
<I>F-Seq Density Signal</I> track annotation that provides a higher resolution
view of the raw sequence data. This track also includes the combined set of
sequences from all replicates.  For each sequence, the aligned read is extended 
to a fragment length of 134 bp from the 5' aligned end
representing the approximate average fragment length.  The score at each base
pair represents the number of extended fragments that overlap the base pair.
</DD></P>
<P>
<DT><I>Uniqueness</I></DT><DD>
The <EM>Duke uniqueness</EM> tracks were used in
the background models for use with F-seq.  These tracks identify regions of 
sequence that appear one, two, three, four, or more than four times within the 
genome for different tag lengths. The tracks help identify regions where 
high-throughput sequence tags cannot be mapped.
</DD></P>
<P>
<DT><I>Excluded Regions</I></DT><DD>The <EM>Duke excluded regions</EM> track
was used to identify problematic regions for short sequence tag signal
detection (such as satellites and rRNA genes). These regions of the genome were
excluded from the Open Chromatin FAIRE Peaks tracks.</DD>
</DD></P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved <A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell"
TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
</P>
<P>
<em>FAIRE</em> was performed (Giresi <em>et al.</em>, 2007) by cross-linking proteins
to DNA using 1% formaldehyde solution, and the complex was sheared using
sonication.  Phenol/chloroform extractions were performed to remove DNA
fragments cross-linked to protein. The DNA recovered in the aqueous phase was
hybridized to NimbleGen Human ENCODE tiling arrays (1% of the genome) and sequenced
using a Solexa sequencing system.  The ENCODE array data were used to verify
the accuracy of the sequencing data, and multiple independent growths
(replicates) were compared to assess the reproducibility of the data.
A more detailed protocol is available
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/general/FAIRE_UNC_procedure.pdf">here</A>.
Also see Giresi <em>et al.</em>, 2009.</P>
</P>
<P>
DNA fragments isolated by FAIRE are 100-200 bp in length, with the average length 
being 134 bp. Sequences from each experiment were aligned to the genome using 
BWA (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2010) for the NCBI 36 (hg19) assembly.  The command used for these alignments was:
<BR><DT> > bwa aln -t 8 genome.fa s_1.sequence.txt.bfq > s_1.sequence.txt.sai</DT>
<BR>Where genome.fa is the whole genome sequence and s_1.sequence.txt.bfq is one lane
of sequences convert into the required bfq format.  Sequences from multiple lanes 
are combined for a single replicate using the bwa samse command, and converted 
in the sam/bam format using samtools.
</p>
<P>
Only those that aligned to 4 or fewer locations were retained. Other sequences 
were also filtered based on their alignment to problematic regions 
(such as satellites and rRNA genes - see The <em>Duke excluded regions</em> track). 
The mappings of these short reads to the genome are available for

TARGET=_BLANK>download</A>.</P>
<P>
The resulting digital signal was converted to a continuous wiggle track using 
F-Seq that employs Parzen kernel density estimation to create base pair scores
(Boyle <em>et al.</em>, 2008b).  Input data has been generated for several 
cell lines. These are used directly to create a control/background model used 
for F-Seq when generating signal annotations for these cell lines.
These models are meant to correct for sequencing biases, alignment artifacts, 
and copy number changes in these cell lines. Input data is not being generated 
directly for other cell lines. Instead, a general background model was derived 
from the available Input data sets. This should provide corrections for 
sequencing biases and alignment artifacts, but will not correct for cell 
type specific copy number changes.  The exact command used for this step is:
<BR><DT> > fseq -l 800 -v -b (bff files) -p (iff files) aligments.bed</DT>
<BR>Where the (bff files) are the background files based on alignability, the 
(iff files) are the background files based on the Input experiments, 
and alignments.bed are a bed file of filtered sequence alignments.</P>
<P>Discrete FAIRE sites (peaks) were identified from FAIRE-seq F-seq 
density signal.  Significant regions were determined by fitting the 
data to a gamma distribution to calculate p-values.  Contiguous regions
where p-values were below a 0.05/0.01 threshold were considered significant.</P>
<P>
A second method to identify discrete peak sites was also used. Enriched regions
for FAIRE data were called using ZINBA (Zero Inflated Negative Binomial 
Algorithm). ZINBA is a flexible statistical method that uses a generalized 
linear model to select genomic windows with enriched sequence counts after 
adjusting for relevant confounding factors such as mapability, GC content, 
and copy number alterations. Significant regions are selected using the set
of standardized residuals below a false discovery rate (qvalue) threshold. 
Peaks were further refined using a shape detection algorithm to identify 
local maxima and boundaries of the Raw Base Overlap Signal within each significant region.
</P>
<P>
ENCODE Array data were normalized using the Tukey biweight normalization, and
peaks were called using ChIPOTle (Buck, <em>et al.</em>, 2005) at multiple
levels of significance.  Regions matched on size to these peaks that were
devoid of any significant signal were also created to allow for ROC analysis.
</P>
