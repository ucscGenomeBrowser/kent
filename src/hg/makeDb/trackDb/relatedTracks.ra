hg38 grcIncidentDb liftHg19 LiftOver for hg38, explores how incident regions aligned between human assemblies

hg38 ReMap liftHg19 NCBI ReMap, even though it has the same name, is a liftOver-like hg19/hg38 alignment, and unrelated to the ReMap database
hg38 liftHg19 ReMap ReMap, even though it has the same name, is a database of transcription factor binding sites, unrelated to NCBI ReMap

hg38 ReMap jaspar JASPAR is a database of predicted TF binding sites, based on short DNA matches. Unlike ReMap, the data is purely computational.

hg38 jaspar ReMap ReMap is a database of TF binding sites inferred from ChIP-Seq Data. Unlike JASPAR predictions, these sites are supported by functional assay

hg38 problematic mappability The mappability track contains regions where short sequencing reads are hard to align
hg38 mappability problematic The problematic regions track contains various gene clusters and the ENCODE blacklist
hg38 problematic grcIncidentDb The GRC (Genome Reference Consortium) incidents track contains regions that were flagged by the group that puts together the genome 
hg38 grcIncidentDb problematic The problematic regions track lists unusual regions and the ones that often lead to artefacts when aligning reads to the reference genome

hg38 phasedVars varFreqs The variant frequencies track contains projects where variant frequencies, aka allele frequencies, are publicly available.
hg38 varFreqs phasedVars The phased variants track contains projects that provide haplotype-phased genotypes/variants.
