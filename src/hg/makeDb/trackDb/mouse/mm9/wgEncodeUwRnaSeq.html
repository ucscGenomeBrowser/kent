<H2>Description</H2>

<p>This track was produced as part of the mouse ENCODE Project.
This track shows RNA-seq measured genome-wide in mouse
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType"> tissues and cell lines</A>.
Poly-A selected mRNA was used as the source for transcriptome profiling of tissues and cell types 
that also had corresponding DNase I hypersensitive profiles.

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types (<EM>views</EM>). 
For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display individually on the browser. Instructions 
for configuring multi-view tracks are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
Color differences among the views are arbitrary and they provide a visual cue for distinguishing
between the different cell and tissue types.  This track contains the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Plus</I> and <I>Minus</I> <I>Signals</I><DD>These views display clusters of overlapping read mappings 
on the forward and reverse genomic strands.<DD> 
<DT><I>Signal</I></DT><DD>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on processed data.</DD>
<DT><I>Alignments</I></DT><DD>Mappings of short 50-base single end reads to the genome.  See the <A HREF="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf" TARGET="_BLANK">SAM Format Specification</A> for more information on the SAM/BAM file format. <DD>
</DL>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<p>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell/mouse" target="_blank">ENCODE cell culture protocols</a>.
Fresh tissues were harvested from mice and stored until used for preparing total RNA samples.  The total RNA 
was used as starting material to select poly-A RNA and used for constructing SOLiD libraries according to the 
protocols supplied by the manufacturer.  All RNA samples were spiked in with NIST standards before libraries were constructed.
 The RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on ABI SOLiD sequencing platform as 50-base reads according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
<p>
Reads were aligned to the mm9 reference genome using ABI BioScope software version 1.2.1.  Colorspace FASTQ format files were created 
using Heng Li's solid2fastq.pl script version 0.1.4 (Li <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009a), representing 0, 1, 2, 3 color codes with the letters A, C, G, T respectively.  
 Signal files were created from the BAM (Li <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009b) alignments using BEDTools (Quinlan <EM>et al.</EM>, 2010).
