<H2>Description</H2>
This track depicts gaps in the assembly.  These gaps - with the
exception of intractable heterochromatic gaps - will be closed during the
finishing process. 
</P><P>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
If the relative order and orientation of the contigs on either side
of the gap is known, it is a <em>bridged</em> gap and a white line is drawn 
through the black box representing the gap. 
</P>
<P>This assembly contains the following principal types of gaps:
<UL>
<LI><B>Clone</B> - gaps not spanned by a scaffold from any of the three 
original assemblies.
<LI><B>Fragment</B> - gaps between contigs that are bridged by a scaffold.
(In this context, a contig is a set of overlapping sequence reads.)
</UL></P>
