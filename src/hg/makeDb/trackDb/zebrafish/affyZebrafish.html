<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the location of the consensus sequences used for the 
selection of probes on the Affymetrix Zebrafish genome chip. 
</P> 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Consensus sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=zebrafish" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> web page.
The sequences were mapped to the genome with blat followed by pslCDnaFilter 
using the parameters <TT>-localNearBest=0.005</TT>,<TT> -minQSize=20</TT>,
<TT> -minNonRepSize=16</TT>,<TT> -ignoreNs</TT>,<TT> -bestOverlap</TT>,
<TT> -minId=0.95</TT> and <TT>-minCover=0.15</TT>.  </P>
