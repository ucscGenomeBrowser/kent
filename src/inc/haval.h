 *      HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with the following
 *      collision-resistant property:
 *             It is computationally infeasible to find two or more
 *             messages that are hashed into the same fingerprint.

 *      This library provides routines to hash

 *        -  a 32-word block, and
 *        -  a string of specified length.
