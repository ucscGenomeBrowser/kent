<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows alternate mouse strain sequences indicated by the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/mouse/index.shtml"
target="_blank">GRC</a> (Genome Reference Consortium) mapped to the
GRCm38 (mm10) reference sequence in an effort to provide the best possible
reference assembly for the mouse genome.  The GRC does this by generating
multiple representations, alternate loci, for regions that are too complex
to be represented by a single path.  This allows users who are interested in a
specific locus to get an improved representation without affecting users who
need chromosome coordinate stability.
</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>

<p>
The <em>Alignment</em> track is the PSL representation of the <em>lastz</em>
chained alignments of the alternate strain sequences to their mapped
location on the reference sequence.  This PSL representation allows the
side-by-side alignment to be viewed.  It was created from the <em>lastz</em>
chained alignments using the <em>chainToPsl</em> kent source utility.
This track follows the display conventions for
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html#PSLDisplay" target="_blank">
PSL alignment tracks</a>. Alignments are displayed in <b>black</b> and,
depending on the track configuration settings, may be interspersed with
vertical <font color="#F88017"><b>orange</b></font> lines.

<h3><font color="#FF0000">Alternate strains</font></h3>

<p>
Items in the <font color="#FF0000"><em>Alt. strains</em></font> track indicate
where the alternate mouse strain sequences map to the reference genome
location.  Clicking on an item in this track will display the detail page
for that item, including a link to the nucleotide sequence at NCBI/Genbank
for the alternate mouse strain.  Data points in this track are always
displayed in <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font>.
</p>
<p>
The locations of the <font color="#FF0000"><em>Alternate strains</em></font>
were established by NCBI and specified in the
<em>alt_scaffold_placement.txt</em> files at, for example, strain NOD_ShiLtJ:<br>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Mus_musculus/GRCm38.p1/NOD_ShiLtJ/alt_scaffolds/alt_scaffold_placement.txt"
TARGET=_blank>GRCm38.p1/NOD_ShiLtJ/alt_scaffolds/alt_scaffold_placement.txt</A>.
Note that each alternate strain has a unique directory at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Mus_musculus/GRCm38.p1/"
TARGET=_blank>Mus_musculus/GRCm38.p1/</A>.
