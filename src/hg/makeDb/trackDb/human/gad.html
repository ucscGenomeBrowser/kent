<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The <a href="http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/cgi-bin/CDC/index.cgi">Genetic Association Database</a> 
is an archive of human genetic association studies of complex diseases and disorders. The goal of the database is to allow the user to rapidly identify medically relevant polymorphism from the large volume of polymorphism and mutational data, in the context of standardized nomenclature.

<P>
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/search/aboutHPLD.htm">HuGE Published Literature</a>, is a web based knowledge base that tracks the growing published literature of human genome epidemiologic studies. HuGE Published Literature offers a starting point for assembling articles for meta-analysis, highlighting research gaps, suggesting applied research questions, and identifying potential collaborators.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
<B>GAD:</B> Study data is recorded in the context of official human gene nomenclature with additional molecular reference numbers and links. It is gene centered. That is, each record is a record of a gene or marker. If a study investigated 6 genes for a particular disorder, there will be 6 records. Gene information is standardized, and annotated with molecular information, enabling integration with other molecular and genomic data resources.
</P>
<P>
<B>HuGE Published Literature:</B> This database consists of links to PubMed entries, extracted weekly since October 21, 2000. It references articles concerning genes, diseases and health outcomes, interacting personal or environmental factors. Articles are included if they present data on any one of five topics: genotype prevalence, gene-disease associations, gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, or the validity or utility of genetic tests.
