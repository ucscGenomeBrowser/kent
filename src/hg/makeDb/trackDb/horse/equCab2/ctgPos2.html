<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The genome has been sequenced to 6.8X coverage.  See also <a href='http://www.broad.mit.edu/ftp/pub/assemblies/mammals/horse/Equus2/BasicStats.out'>Broad Institute Assembly Statistics</a>.
</P>
<P>
There are 55,815 contigs in the assembly containing 2,454,407,628 nucleotides.
The mean size of these contigs is 43,974 bases, with an N50 measurement of
6,319 contigs of size 112,340 bases or larger containing half of the sequence.
</P>

<P>
The smaller contigs have been assembled into two types of supercontigs.
88 supercontigs named scaffold_0 through scaffold_87 containing 2,268,857,329 nucleotides
comprise chromosome 1-31 and chromosome X.
The mean size of these supercontigs is 30,660,234 bases, with an N50 measurement
of 33 supercontigs of size 53,663,962 bases or larger containing half of the
sequence.
</P>

<P>
There are also 9604 supercontigs named chrUn0001 through chrUn9604 containing 107,858,955 bases.
The UCSC genome browser combines these supercontigs together as an
artifical chromosome chrUn with 1,000 base gaps between these supercontigs.
This chrUn sequence is 117,461,955 bases, with artificial 1,000 base
gaps covering 9,603,000 bases.
