<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the accessibility of genomic DNA to DNase I digestion
in the D. melanogaster embryo for five stages of development: 5, 9,
10, 11 and 14 (Thomas <em>et al.</em>). These data have been used to show the
dynamics of chromatin accessibility during embryogenesis (Thomas <em>et
al</em>) and that chromatin accessibility plays a dominant role in
determining the widespread, overlapping patterns of binding by
functionally distinct transcription factors in Drosophila embryos (Li
<em>et al.</em>; Kaplan <em>et al.</em>).</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Subtracks are provided showing either the density of DNA sequence tags
in 75 bp windows across the genome or the locations of 5% FDR
accessible regions. DNA sequence tag density data for independent
replica for each stage are provided, though by default only one
replica is shown. The DNA tag density subtracks are by default shown
in &quot;full&quot; and the locations of 5% FDR regions that are concordant
in both replicas are shown in &quot;squish&quot;. Data for each stage is shown in
a different color: green for stage 5, orange for stage 9, red for
stage 10, light blue for stage 11 and purple for stage 14.</P>
<P>
The graphical configuration options for the subtracks are shown at the
top of the track controls page, followed by a list of subtracks. To
show only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks
that you wish to hide. For more information about the graphical
configuration options, click the Graph configuration help link.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
One hour collections of wild type embryos were aged to the appropriate
developmental stage and then nuclei were isolated and briefly digested
with DNase I. The DNA released by digestion was size fractionated
through a sucrose gradient to capture 100 - 400 bp fragments, which
were then used to generate an average of ~14 million sequence tags per
sample to the Drosophila genome with an Illumina GA2. 
The data were analyzed to determine short genomic regions that are
accessible to digestion at a 5% false discovery rate; see Thomas
<em>et al.</em> for further details.</P>
