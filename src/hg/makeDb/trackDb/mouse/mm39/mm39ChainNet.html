<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Chain Track</h3>
<p>
The chain track shows alignments of $organism ($date/$db) to
other genomes using a gap scoring system that allows longer gaps 
than traditional affine gap scoring systems. It can also tolerate gaps in both
$organism and the other genome simultaneously. These 
&quot;double-sided&quot; gaps can be caused by local inversions and 
overlapping deletions in both species. 
<p>
The chain track displays boxes joined together by either single or
double lines. The boxes represent aligning regions.
Single lines indicate gaps that are largely due to a deletion in the
other assembly or an insertion in the $organism assembly.
Double lines represent more complex gaps that involve substantial
sequence in both species. This may result from inversions, overlapping
deletions, an abundance of local mutation, or an unsequenced gap in one
species.  In cases where multiple chains align over a particular region of
the other genome, the chains with single-lined gaps are often 
due to processed pseudogenes, while chains with double-lined gaps are more 
often due to paralogs and unprocessed pseudogenes.</p> 
<p>
In the "pack" and "full" display
modes, the individual feature names indicate the chromosome, strand, and
location (in thousands) of the match for each matching alignment.</p>

<h3>Net Track</h3>
<p>
The net track shows the best $organism/other chain for 
every part of the other genome. It is useful for
finding orthologous regions and for studying genome
rearrangement.  The $organism sequence used in this annotation is from
the $date ($db) assembly.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
Multiple species are grouped together in a composite track.  In the display 
and on the configuration page, an effort was made to group them loosely 
into "clades."  These groupings are based on the taxonomic classification 
at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy" target=_BLANK>NCBI</a>,
using the CommonTree tool.

Some organisms may be pulled from a larger group into a subgroup, to emphasize 
a relationship.  For example, members of an Order may be listed together, while 
other organisms in the same Superorder may be grouped separately under the
Superorder name.
</p>

<h3>Chain Track</h3>
<p>By default, the chains to chromosome-based assemblies are colored
based on which chromosome they map to in the aligning organism. To turn
off the coloring, check the &quot;off&quot; button next to: Color
track based on chromosome.</p>
<p>
To display only the chains of one chromosome in the aligning
organism, enter the name of that chromosome (e.g. chr4) in box next to: 
Filter by chromosome.</p>

<h3>Net Track</h3>
<p>
In full display mode, the top-level (level 1)
chains are the largest, highest-scoring chains that
span this region.  In many cases gaps exist in the
top-level chain.  When possible, these are filled in by
other chains that are displayed at level 2.  The gaps in 
level 2 chains may be filled by level 3 chains and so
forth. </p>
<p>
In the graphical display, the boxes represent ungapped 
alignments; the lines represent gaps.  Click
on a box to view detailed information about the chain
as a whole; click on a line to display information
about the gap.  The detailed information is useful in determining
the cause of the gap or, for lower level chains, the genomic
rearrangement. </p> 
<p> 
Individual items in the display are categorized as one of four types
(other than gap):</p>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Top</b> - the best, longest match. Displayed on level 1.
<li><b>Syn</b> - line-ups on the same chromosome as the gap in the level above
it.
<li><b>Inv</b> - a line-up on the same chromosome as the gap above it, but in 
the opposite orientation.
<li><b>NonSyn</b> - a match to a chromosome different from the gap in the 
level above.
</ul></p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<h3>Chain track</h3>
<p>
The lastz alignments were converted into axt format using the lavToAxt
program. The axt alignments were fed into axtChain, which organizes all
alignments between a single $organism chromosome and a single
chromosome from the other genome into a group and creates a kd-tree out
of the gapless subsections (blocks) of the alignments. A dynamic program
was then run over the kd-trees to find the maximally scoring chains of these
blocks.

<h3>Net track</h3>
<p>
Chains were derived from lastz alignments, using the methods
described on the chain tracks description pages, and sorted with the 
highest-scoring chains in the genome ranked first. The program
chainNet was then used to place the chains one at a time, trimming them as 
necessary to fit into sections not already covered by a higher-scoring chain. 
During this process, a natural hierarchy emerged in which a chain that filled 
a gap in a higher-scoring chain was placed underneath that chain. The program 
netSyntenic was used to fill in information about the relationship between 
higher- and lower-level chains, such as whether a lower-level
chain was syntenic or inverted relative to the higher-level chain. 
The program netClass was then used to fill in how much of the gaps and chains 
contained <em>N</em>s (sequencing gaps) in one or both species and how much
was filled with transposons inserted before and after the two organisms 
diverged.</p>
