<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows all gaps (any sequence of N's) in the 11 Jan 2017 <em>Mus caroli </em>/GCA_900094665.1_CAROLI_EIJ_v1 genome assembly.  Not all gaps were annotated in the AGP file, this track includes all sequences of N's in the assembly.

</p>
<p>
Any sequence of N's in the assembly is marked as a gap in this track.
The standard gap track only shows the gaps as annotated in the AGP file:
