<h1>trackDbIndexBb - A utility to support hideEmptySubtracks on Composite Tracks</h1> 
<p>
When there are many subtracks in a composite view, it may be useful to limit the 
display to only those with data in the current viewing window. The trackDb setting, 
<a target="_blank" 
href="/goldenPath/help/trackDb/trackDbHub.html#hideEmptySubtracks">hideEmptySubtracks</a>,
enables this behavior. This track setting produces a checkbox on the track configuration 
page allowing the user to enable or disable this feature. If it is configured to 'on', 
then the feature will be on by default (the checkbox is checked). To take 
full advantage of this setting it is helpful, though not always required, to index the 
underlying bigBed files, using the <code>trackDbIndexBb</code> utility. This utility
creates multibed/index files containing the coordinates where the tracks intersect,
expediting data lookup. There are two instances in which these files are helpful or required:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>(helpful)</b> In large composites (dozens or hundreds of tracks), especially when subtrack
data are sparse, the index files will provide a substantial performance improvement.</li>
<li><b>(required)</b> For building track associations. An example of this is when it is desired
to display peak and signal tracks together. Because <code>hideEmptySubtracks</code> works
only on bigBed tracks (peaks), associated tracks (such as bigWig signals) can be designated
to be displayed alongside the bigBeds with data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To build the index files, first download the <code>trackDbIndexBb</code> utility. 
For more information on downloading our command line utilities, see these 
<a href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>
There are three other programs needed to run <code>trackDbIndexBb</code>. Two of them,
<code>bedToBigBed</code> and <code>bigBedToBed</code>, can be found
in the same <a href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">
downloads directory</a>.
The final dependency, <b>bedtools</b>, can be found on the <a target="_blank" 
href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">bedtools site</a>.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
Kent utilities can be run with no parameters to display a usage message. 
Additionally, <code>trackDbIndexBb</code> can be passed the
<code>-	h</code> flag to display a more verbose help message.</p>
<pre>
./trackDbIndexBb
./trackDbIndexBb -h
</pre>
<p> 
Below is a short description of the parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>trackName</b> | The name of the composite containing the bigBed tracks
to be indexed. Higher-level composite names may be used to build track associations.
This means that all tracks in the hierarchy <em>below</em> trackName will be searched 
for indexing and associations.</li>
<li><b>raFile</b> | The location of the trackDb.ra file containing the bigDataUrls
of the bigBeds to be indexed.</li>
<li><b>chromSizes</b> | Location of the chrom.sizes file. This file contains the names
and sizes of the chromosomes for the working assembly. This can be generated from the 2bit genome, 
downloaded from the respective assembly on our <a target="_blank" 
href="http://hgdownload.gi.ucsc.edu/downloads.html">download server</a>, or fetched using the 
<code>fetchChromSizes</code> utility found in the same directory as <code>trackDbIndexBb</code>.
</li>
<li><b>-o --out</b> | (Optional) Path to the output directory where the resulting files will 
be placed. Defaults to current directory.</li>
<li><b>-p --pathTools</b> | (Optional) Location where the dependent programs can be found. 
Will automatically check current directory and user's path. <code>trackDbIndexBb</code> 
has three dependencies listed above. Note that bedtools must be downloaded from an 
external group.</li>
<li><b>-n --noDelete</b> | (Optional) Keep intermediary multiBed file.</li>
<li><b>-m --metaDataVar</b> | (Optional) Used only when building track associations. The variable
designated here will be a trackDb variable which can be used to associate tracks. Default value is
<em>subGroups</em>, though <em>metaData</em> is also commonly used. See example below for more 
information.</li>
<li><b>-s --subGroupRemove</b> | (Optional) Used only when building track associations. In 
conjunction with <b>--metaDataVar</b>, this variable is used to build track associations. The
value designated will be excluded as a matching requirement from the trackDb parameter. By 
default, <em>view</em> is used, though this can change depending on data and organization. 
See example below for more information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example 1 - Building Index Files</h2>
<p>
In this first example, we will build index files for a composite track
containing 12 bigBed files. Index files hardly improve performance
on a track with so few files, however, the steps would be the same
on a larger track.</p>
<p>
First, we can take a look at the header stanza for the composite. The complete
trackDb.ra file is available <a target=_blank" 
href="/goldenPath/help/examples/trackDbIndexBb/smallExampleTrackDb.ra">here</a>.</p>
<pre>
track problematic
shortLabel Problematic Regions
longLabel Problematic Regions for NGS or Sanger sequencing or very variable regions
compositeTrack on
hideEmptySubtracks off
group map
visibility hide
type bigBed 3 +
</pre>
<p>
We can see that the <code>hideEmptySubtracks</code> setting is already enabled,
set off by default. The index files we are building are not required, but instead,
improve the performance of the feature. This also gives us
the composite track name, <em>problematic</em>. We will want to pass this
as our <b>trackName</b> variable.</p>
<p>
The other two required parameters are the path to the trackDb.ra file, 
and the chrom.sizes file. If we assume both of those are in the current directory,
and that the required dependencies are present in the path, we can run
<code>trackDbIndexBb</code> as such:</p>
<pre>
./trackDbIndexBb problematic smallExampleTrackDb.ra hg19.chrom.sizes
</pre>
<p>
This will generate two files in the current directory:</p>
<pre>
problematic.multiBed.bb
problematic.multiBedSources.tab
</pre>
<p>
We can then enable the use of these index files for <code>hideEmptySubtracks</code> by
adding the following two lines to our trackDb.ra file, adjusting the path if needed:</p>
<pre>
hideEmptySubtracks off
hideEmptySubtracksMultiBedUrl problematic.multiBed.bb
hideEmptySubtracksSourcesUrl problematic.multiBedSources.tab
</pre>

<h2>Example 2 - Creating Track Associations</h2>
<p>
In this longer example, we are looking to build index files with track associations between 
DNase-seq peak and signal tracks. There are 2 bigBed peak tracks and 4 bigWig signal tracks.
The complete trackDb for the example can be found <a target=_blank" 
href="/goldenPath/help/examples/trackDbIndexBb/exampleTrackDb.ra">here</a>.</p> 
<p>
Looking at the
top level stanza, we see that this composite track has two views, one for
peaks and one for signals. The data are associated with a few different subGroups:</p>
<pre>
track uniformDnase
subGroup4 lab Lab Duke=Duke UW=UW UWDuke=UW-Duke
subGroup3 view View Peaks=Peaks Signal=Signal
subGroup2 cellType Cell_Line GM12878=GM12878 H1-hESC=H1-hESC
</pre>
<p>
To help us decide how to best make these associations, let us see what parts of
the peak and signal stanzas we would like to associate are relevant:</p>
<pre>
                track wgEncodeUWDukeDnaseGM12878FdrPeaks
                type bigBed 6 +
                parent uniformDnasePeaks on
                bigDataUrl wgEncodeUWDukeDnaseGM12878.fdr01peaks.hg19.bb
                subGroups view=Peaks tier=t1 cellType=GM12878 lab=UWDuke
                metadata cell=GM12878

                track wgEncodeDukeDnaseGM12878FdrSignal
                type bigWig
                parent uniformDnaseSignal on
                bigDataUrl wgEncodeOpenChromDnaseGm12878Aln_5Reps.norm5.rawsignal.bw
                subGroups view=Signal tier=t1 cellType=GM12878 lab=Duke
                metadata cell=GM12878 lab=Duke

                track wgEncodeUWDnaseGM12878FdrSignal
                type bigWig
                parent uniformDnaseSignal on
                bigDataUrl wgEncodeUwDnaseGm12878Aln_2Reps.norm5.rawsignal.bw
                subGroups view=Signal tier=t1 cellType=GM12878 lab=UW
                metadata cell=GM12878 lab=UW
</pre>
<p>
The first track is the bigBed peaks track (peaks view) and the second
and third are bigWig signal tracks (signal view). <code>hideEmptySubtracks</code>
allows for two optional variables to build track associations. The first, <b>-m --metaDataVar</b>,
designates which trackDb variable will be used to build the association. In this example, the peaks
are determined using a combination of the signal tracks, therefore, we would like to
display both of the signal tracks whenever the peak track has data.</p>
<p>
At this point, it is important to explain how <code>trackDbIndexBb</code> makes track associations.
It will look at the stanza variable line designated by <b>-m --metaDataVar</b>, then look for
identical matching lines in other stanzas. Since at least one parameter within will usually
differ, such as the designation between peak and signal, <b>-s --subGroupRemove</b> can be used 
to strip out one of the parameters in the line.</p>
<p>
The <b>subGroups</b> parameter could be used. However, we see that the two variables that 
differ between the peak and signal stanzas are <em>view</em> and <em>lab</em>. 
We would have to strip 
both of those to have matching parameter variables and build an association. Alternatively, 
we could use the <b>metaData</b> parameter. This parameter associates the tracks 
by the <em>cell</em>, with only the <em>lab</em> variable differing. This would be the best 
choice as only a single parameter would have to be stripped, <em>lab</em>, as opposed to two,
<em>lab</em> and <em>view</em>, to have matching peak and signal parameters for related tracks.</p>
<p>
Now that we know which parameter we would like to use to build associations, we need to use the
second optional parameter, <b>-s --subGroupRemove</b>, to tell <code>hideEmptySubtracks</code>
which variables to strip out in making the association. In this case, we would like to
keep the <em>cell</em> variable, but strip the <em>lab</em>. This means that <em>lab</em> 
will be the parameter passed. In this way, associations will be made between any tracks that 
match the contents of their <b>metaData</b> parameter once the <em>lab</em> variable has been 
stripped out.</p>
<p>
Now that we have chosen our parameters, we will run the utility -- assuming our chrom.sizes file,
our trackDb.ra file, and all the supporting programs (bedToBigBed, bigBedToBed, bedtools) are
present in the current directory. We will also choose the output to be the current directory:</p>
<pre>
./trackDbIndexBb uniformDnase exampleTrackDb.ra chrom.sizes -o . -p . -m metadata -s lab
</pre>
<p>
Note that in this case, we could have omitted the <b>-o</b> and <b>-p</b> values as the 
current directory is the default for both.</p>
<p>
In this small example, the utility would run in a few seconds. But larger inputs containing
hundreds of tracks can take hours. Upon completion, two files will be generated:</p>
<pre>
uniformDnase.multiBed.bb
uniformDnase.multiBedSources.tab
</pre>
<p>
The .bb file will be a big multibed containing the coordinates where the tracks intersect, 
expediting data lookup, and the .tab file will serve as an index for the multibed while
also containing the track associations. The .tab file can be quickly examined to ensure
proper generation as it should contain a numerical first column, followed by the bigBed
track, then any number of desired track associations, e.g.</p>
<pre>
1	wgEncodeUWDukeDnaseGM12878FdrPeaks	wgEncodeDukeDnaseGM12878FdrSignal	wgEncodeUWDnaseGM12878FdrSignal
2	wgEncodeUWDukeDnaseH1hESCFdrPeaks	wgEncodeDukeDnaseH1hESCFdrSignal	wgEncodeUWDnaseH1hESCFdrSignal
</pre>
<p>
Finally, <a target="_blank" 
href="/goldenPath/help/trackDb/trackDbHub.html#hideEmptySubtracks">hideEmptySubtracks</a> can be 
enabled and pointed to the newly generated files on the top composite stanza:</p>
<pre>
hideEmptySubtracks on
hideEmptySubtracksMultiBedUrl uniformDnase.multiBed.bb 
hideEmptySubtracksSourcesUrl uniformDnase.multiBedSources.tab
</pre>
