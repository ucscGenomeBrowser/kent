<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays translated 
<A HREF="../cgi-bin/hgBlat?db=$db" TARGET=_blank>blat</A>
alignments of non-$organism vertebrate ESTs from 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html" 
TARGET=_blank>GenBank</A>. </P>

<P>The strand information (+/-) for this track is in two parts.  The
first + or - indicates the orientation of the query sequence whose
translated protein produced the match.  The second + or - indicates the
orientation of the matching translated genomic sequence.  Because the two
orientations of a DNA sequence give different predicted protein sequences,
there are four combinations.  ++ is not the same as --; nor is +- the same
as -+.

<H2>Method</H2>
<P>
To generate this track, the ESTs are aligned against the genome using the blat
program. The alignments are passed through a piecewise near-best-in-genome
filter.</P>

<H2>Using the Filter</H2>
<P>
The track filter can be used to change the color or include/exclude a subset 
of individual items within a track. This is helpful when many items are shown 
in the track display, especially when only some are relevant to the current 
task.  The filter is accessible via the minibutton in the browser display or 
using the link in the track-control section.  To use the filter:
<OL>
<LI>Enter a value in one or more of the text boxes to filter the EST display. For
example, to apply the filter to all ESTs expressed in the liver, type &quot;liver&quot; in the 
tissue box. For a list of permissible filter values, consult the non-positional table in
the Table Browser that corresponds to the factor on which you wish to filter. For
example, the non-positional table &quot;tissue&quot; contains all of the types of tissues
that can be entered into the tissue text box. Wildcards can also be used in the
filter.
<LI>If filtering on more than one value, choose the desired combination
logic. If &quot;and&quot; is selected, only ESTs that match all of the filter criteria will
be highlighted. If &quot;or&quot; is selected, ESTs that match any 1 of the filter criteria
will be highlighted.
<LI>Choose the color or display characteristic that should be used to highlight or
include/exclude the filtered items. If &quot;exclude&quot; is chosen, the browser will not 
display ESTs that match the filter criteria. If &quot;include&quot; is selected, the browser 
will display only those ESTs that match the filter criteria.
</OL></P>
<P>When you have finished configuring the filter, click the <em>Submit</em> button.</P>
