<H2> Methods </H2>

<H3>  Eddy-tRNAscanSE      (tRNA genes, Sean Eddy) </H3>
       tRNAscan-SE 1.23 w/ default parameters.
       Score field contains tRNAscan-SE bit score; >20 is good, >50 is great.
       
<H3>  Eddy-BLAST-tRNAlib   (tRNA pseudogenes, Sean Eddy) </H3>
       WUBLAST 2.0, w/ options "-kap wordmask=seg B=50000 W=8 cpus=1".
       Score field contains % identity in BLAST-aligned region.
       Used each of 602 tRNAs and pseudogenes predicted by tRNAscan-SE
       in the human oo27 assembly as queries; kept all nonoverlapping
       regions that hit one or more of these w/ P <= 0.001. 
       
<H3>  Eddy-BLAST-snornalib (known snoRNAs and snoRNA pseudogenes, Steve Johnson) </H3>
       WUBLASTN 2.0, w/ options "-V=25 -hspmax=5000 -kap wordmask=seg 
       B=5000 W=8 cpus=1".
       Score field contains BLAST score.
       Used each of 104 unique snoRNAs in snorna.lib as a query.
       Any hit >=95% full length and >=90% identity is annotated as a
       "true gene".
       Any other hit with P <= 0.001 is annotated as a "related sequence",
       and interpreted as a putative pseudogene.
       
<H3>  Eddy-BLAST-otherrnalib </H3>
       (non-tRNA, non-snoRNA noncoding RNAs with Genbank entries
        for the human gene.)
       WUBLASTN 2.0 [15 Apr 2002]
         w/ options: "-kap -cpus=1 -wordmask=seg -W=8 -E=0.01 -hspmax=0
                       -B=50000 -Z=3000000000"
       <BR>  Exceptions:
       <UL>
       <LI>        Large ncRNAs: (LSU & SSU rRNA, H19, Xist)
                   change "-W=11"; addition "-maskextra=50"
                   Xist contains repetitive elements and was masked with
                   RepeatMasker, Library version 6.8. </LI>
       <LI>        microRNAs:
                   "-kap -cpus=1 -S=70 -hspmax=0 -B=100" replaces all 
                   above parameters. </LI>
       </UL>
       Score field contains BLASTN score. 
       Used 41 unique miRNA, and 29 other ncRNAs as queries.
       Any hit >=95% full length and >=95% identity is annotated as a 
       "true gene".
       Any other hit with P <= 0.001 and >= 65% identity is annotated
       as a "related sequence".
       Exceptions: all miRNAs consist of 16-26bp sequences in Genbank 
       and are only annotated if 100% full length and 100% identity. 
       miRNAs consist of Let-7 from Pasquinelli et al., 
       Nature (2000) 408:86; 40 from Mourelatos et al., Gene & Dev (2002) 
       16:720.
