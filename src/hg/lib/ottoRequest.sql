# ottoRequest.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated ottoRequest.c and ottoRequest.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#recording requests coming from from functions such as liftRequest
CREATE TABLE ottoRequest (
    id int unsigned not null auto_increment,	# Auto-incrementing request count
    fromDb varchar(255) not null,	# can be a database name or a GC[AF]_ GenArk accession
    toDb varchar(255) not null,	# can be a database name or a GC[AF]_ GenArk accession

    comment longblob not null,	# other comments from the input form
