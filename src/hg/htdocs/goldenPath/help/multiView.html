                                <P>

The drop-down menus in the <EM>Select views</EM> section control the
kind of data tracks that will be displayed, such as &quot;peaks&quot; or
&quot;signal&quot;.  To configure the display of the tracks for each data
type, click on the name of the view next to the drop-down menu.  <EM>Note</EM> that
when a view has been set to <EM>hide</EM> in this section, the corresponding
subtracks will have grayed-out checkboxes in the <EM>List subtracks</EM> 
section below.
<P>
<B>Selecting subtracks</B><BR>
The <EM>Select subtracks</EM> section is a grid of checkboxes that provides
a quick way to select a set of subtracks according to some attribute, such as 
&quot;cell line&quot; or &quot;antibody&quot;.  <EM>Note</EM> that selections made using
these boxes reset any selections made on the individual subtracks in the
<EM>List subtracks</EM> section below.
</P>
<P>
Some tracks allow you to <EM>Select subtracks further by</EM> additional 
categories such as &quot;treatment&quot;. Click on a menu to see all of the 
available choices. Choices that are not compatible with the current set of 
selected subtracks may be grayed out.  Click on one or more choices to select 
them.
</P>
<P>
The <EM>List subtracks</EM> section allows you to select and deselect
individual subtracks. This section provides the most refined control of the
tracks displayed.  Selections made here do not change the selections made in the
<EM>Select views</EM> or <EM>Select subtracks</EM> sections above.
<EM>Note</EM> that if the subtrack list is 
restricted to &quot;only selected/visible&quot; then some available subtracks 
may be hidden from the list.  If the list of subtracks is long, this may be 
useful.
</P>
<P>
<B>Sorting subtracks</B><BR>
The order of subtracks in the <EM>List subtracks</EM> section determines the
display position on the main Genome Browser display page.  Tracks can be
sorted by clicking on the attribute links at the top of the column (if any). 
The arrows next to the attribute links indicate which direction the columns are being sorted.
The numbers next to the arrows indicate the priority of the sort for each
attribute. Additionally, some subtracks can be ordered by 
&quot;drag and drop&quot;:
click and hold a subtrack checkbox in the <EM>List subtracks</EM> section 
and release it in a new position.  <EM>Note</EM> that tracks may be reordered 
by &quot;drag and drop&quot; in the main Genome Browser display.  Those changes
will not be reflected in this list.
</P>
<P>
<B>Configuring individual subtracks</B><BR>
Subtracks can have display and configuration settings that are distinct from the set they belong 
to.  Click on the display mode (hide, dense, etc.) of a subtrack shown in the
<EM>List subtracks</EM> to change it or click on the wrench 
icon (<IMG SRC="../../images/wrench.png">) to change the configuration settings 
for an individual subtrack.  Individual subtrack settings will be overwritten 
anytime the set of tracks is configured as a whole.
</P>
<P>
<B>More details</B><BR>
To learn more about the underlying data for a subtrack, press the down arrow 
(<IMG SRC="../../images/downBlue.png">) 
next to the subtrack name in the <EM>List subtracks</EM> section.  
This section will expand to display information such as the name of the data 
contributor, the cell line and antibody used in the experiment, the data 
submission date and more. To see a full description of the underlying table, 
press the &quot;schema&quot; link.
</P>
<P>
<B>Selecting filter categories</B><BR>
Some tracks allow you to control the items that appear in displayed subtracks
using <EM>Filter items by</EM> categories. Click on a filter menu to see all 
of the available item types. Click on one or more item types to select them.
