The <em>Drosophila yakuba</em> Release 1.0 (Apr. 2004) draft genome sequence 
was produced by the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University 
(WUSTL) School of Medicine in St. Louis.

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of an
mRNA or EST, a chromosomal range, or keywords
from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides
examples of valid position queries for the Drosophila
genome. Note that some position queries (e.g. &quot;huntington&quot;) may return
matches to the mRNA records of other species. In these cases, the
mRNAs are mapped to their homologs in Drosophila.  See the

User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Release 1.0 <em>D. yakuba</em> whole genome shotgun assembly consists of 
11,926 supercontigs larger than 1 kb, with 
a total size of approximately 167.67 Mb and an N50 length of about 1.02 Mb. The
total number of contigs greater than 1 kb is 20,969, with a total size of 
approximately 167.18 Mb and an N50 length of 41,852.
<P>
The sequence is distributed among the following chromosomes: 2L, 2R, 2h (random 
only), 3L, 3R, 3h (random only), 4, X, Xh (random only), Yh (random only), M 
(mitochondria) and U.
Sequence that could not be reliably ordered within a chromosome <em>N</em> has
been placed on chr<em>N</em>_random. Heterochromatin that has been localized to a
specific chromosome can be found in chr<em>N</em>h_random.
