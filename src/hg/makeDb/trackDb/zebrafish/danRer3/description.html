The May 2005 zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) Zv5 assembly was produced by 
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with the Max Planck 
Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, Germany, and the Netherlands
Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The 
Netherlands. 

<H3>Sample position queries</P></H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of
an mRNA or EST, a scaffold range,
<!-- an Ensembl transcript ID, -->
or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides 
examples of various types of position queries for the zebrafish genome. Note 
that some position queries (e.g. "huntington") may return matches to the mRNA 
records of other species. In these cases, the mRNAs are mapped to their 
homologs in zebrafish.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>User Guide</A> for more help.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Zv5 assembly consists of 1,630,306,866 bp in 16,214 scaffolds 
(N50 = 1,116,981 bp) with a sequence coverage of approximately 6.5-7x. 
The assembly has been tied to the FPC map (data freeze 15th February, 2005) 
and contains 699 Mb from 4,519 sequenced clones.
<P>
This assembly was constructed using two different strategies. In the first, 
a whole genome shotgun (WGS) approach was used.  DNA from 1000 five-day-old 
Tuebingen embryos was used to generate plasmid and fosmid libraries. The 
libraries were sequenced and the resulting traces were assembled with the 
Sanger Institute assembler, Phusion. The second approach used traditional 
clone mapping and sequencing techniques to produce a higher quality genome 
sequence. BAC libraries were selected and fingerprinted to generate a 
fingerprint contig (FPC) map. From this map, a tiling path was calculated 
that covered the genome sequence clone-by-clone. Clones from this path were 
selected for high quality sequencing and then pieced together to form the 
genome sequence. 
<P>
74% of the sequence (1,200,129,620 bp) is in FPC contigs and is tied to 
chromosomes 1-25. These contigs provided a template for placing the unfinished 
sequence. The remaining sequence was filled with WGS contigs using a 
combination of sequence alignment and BAC end positions as well as features
such as zebrafish cDNAs and markers. 183,993,739 bp of sequence is in 265 
scaffolds tied to unplaced FPC contigs and there are 246,183,507 bp in 
14,676 NA scaffolds. The WGS assembly consists of 20,541,433 reads totaling 
14,160,626,498 bp and this includes an additional set of 6,882,050 reads from 
a new library generated from a single Tuebingen double haploid zebrafish. Reads were clustered using Phusion, and Phrap was used to assemble clusters and for 
consensus generation. The resulting 247,928 contigs have an N50 size of 
20,629 bp. From these, 105,987 scaffolds or supercontigs were created with an 
N50 size of 687,451 bp.
<P>
The Sanger Institute notes there is high level of misassembly present in 
this release due to the large amount of polymorphism in the DNA source. 
Regions where the physical map is incomplete or contains gaps have sequence
with a higher number of misassemblies. Highly variable regions within the 
genome posed assembly difficulties, most likely because the sequences 
originated from different haplotypes. This also results in assembly dropouts
and duplications.
