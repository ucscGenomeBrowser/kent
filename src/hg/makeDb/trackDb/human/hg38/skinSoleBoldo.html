<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327715/"
target="_blank"><em>Single-cell transcriptomes of the human skin reveal
age-related loss of fibroblast priming</em></a>. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
was performed on sun-protected skin samples prepared using droplet-sequencing 
(drop-seq). RNA profiles were generated for 15,457 cells after quality control 
and subsequent clustering identified 17 clusters with distinct expression profiles
as found in Sol&#233;-Boldo <em>et al</em>., 2020. 
</p>

<p>
This track collection contains four bar chart tracks of RNA expression in the
human skin where cells are grouped by cell type 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoCellType">Skin Cell</a>), age 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoAge">Skin Age</a>),
donor 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoDonor">Skin Donor</a>), and cell type and donor's age 
(<a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoAgeCellType">Skin Cell+Age</a>). The default
track displayed is <a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoCellType">Skin Cell</a>.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the
<a href="hgTrackUi?g=skinSoleBoldoCellType">Skin Cell</a> subtrack, where
the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the
cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>

<p>
Healthy skin samples were obtained from whole-skin specimens belonging to 5
male donors (ages 25-70) with fair skin. Donors underwent full body skin
examinations by a dermatologist and medical records were checked for skin
diseases and/or comorbidities that affect the skin. 4-mm punch biopsies were
taken from surgically removed skin belonging to the inguinal region of the body
also known as the groin. Skin samples were kept in MACS Tissue Storage Solution
for less than 1 hour to avoid necrosis and apoptosis. Enzymatical and
mechanical dissociation was done using the Miltenyi Biotec Whole Skin
Dissociation kit for human material and the Miltenyi Biotec Gentle MACS
dissociator. Drop-seq libraries were prepared using a 10x Genomics 3' v2 kit
and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000.</p>


<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="http://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=aging-human-skin" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>. 
The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types. The UCSC tools can be found on our download
server: <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
