<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the sequencing quality score 
(range: 0 to 99) of each base in the assembly.  
The height of the graph at each position of the track 
indicates the quality of the base.  
When zoomed out to a large range, the heights reflect the averaged scores.  
Scores of 40 or higher reflect high confidence in the sequence (with an error rate of less than 
1/10,000); scores of 20 or higher reflect reasonable confidence (of working draft 
quality).</P>
<P>
This track includes quality scores for all chromosomes asssembled from
whole genome shotgun contigs.  Quality scores for chromosomes generated from 
finished clones (chr21, chrY, and chrY_random) were not available at
the time this track was constructed. Chromosome 7 was
constructed from both contigs and clones; the quality track for
this chromosome contains the contig quality scores, with the
1MB finished region indicated by a manually assigned score of 98.
All other scores in this track range between 0 and 97 inclusive.
