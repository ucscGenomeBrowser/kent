<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the draft assembly of the $organism genome.  

The genome has been sequenced to 8.92X coverage. There are 5,106 scaffolds
comprising 169,747,139 bases, constructed from 18,752 contigs comprising
145,948,246 bases. The UCSC browser displays the 5,106 scaffolds as a
single artifical chromosome chrUn of size 174,852,139 bases with an
artifical gap of 1000 between each scaffold. The largest
scaffold (Contig0) is 2,658,817 bases. One half of the sequence,
84,873,569 bases, is contained in 64 scaffolds, all at least 823,357
bases (N50).

<P>
In dense mode, this track depicts the supercontigs.  Supercontig boundaries
are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Arbitrary 1000 base gaps exist between the supercontigs, shown as
spaces between the gold and brown blocks.
