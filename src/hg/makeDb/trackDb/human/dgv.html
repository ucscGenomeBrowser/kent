<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays copy number variants, insertions/deletions,
inversions and inversion breakpoints annotated by the 
<A HREF="http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/" 
TARGET=_BLANK>Database of Genomic Variants</A> (DGV).  
DGV focuses on structural variation, defined as 
genomic alterations that involve segments of DNA that are larger than
1000bp.  Insertions/deletions of 100bp or larger are also included.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions</H2>
<P>
Types of structural variation are indicated by color: 
copy number variants are orange, insertions/deletions are dark green and 
inversions/inversion breakpoints are red.  
Where DGV has clustered overlapping items of the same type into 
a larger locus, the locus region is indicated by thin bars on one or 
both sides of the actual variant which is indicated by a thick bar.
</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
DGV collects these variants by ongoing manual curation of the literature.  
A brief description of the method and sample used for a particular 
variant is included on the details page, along with a link to the 
PubMed abstract for the study from which the variants were collected.  
</P>
<P>
For data sets where the variation calls are reported at a sample by
sample level, DGV merges calls with similar boundaries across the sample
set. Only variants of the same type (i.e. CNVs, inversions, in/dels)
are merged, and gains and losses are merged separately.  In addition,
if several different platforms/approaches are used within the same
study, these datasets are merged separately. Sample level calls that
overlap by &ge; 70% are merged in this process.
