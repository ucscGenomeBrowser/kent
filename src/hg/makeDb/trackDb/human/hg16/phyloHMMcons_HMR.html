<H2>Description</H2> <P>
This track shows a measure of evolutionary conservation in human, rat, and
mouse that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM).
The alignments used were the multiz alignments of the mouse Feb. 2003 (mm3),
rat Jun. 2003 (rn3), and human Jul. 2003 (hg16) assemblies.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>

    <P>A phylo-HMM is a generative probabilistic model that describes both
    the process of DNA substitution along the branches of a phylogeny at
    each site in an alignment, and changes in the mode of this process from
    one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill [1996], Yang [1995],
    Siepel and Haussler [2003], Siepel and Haussler [submitted]).  Each of
    the states of a phylo-HMM may be associated with a different
    phylogenetic model, describing both the overall <em>rates</em> of
    substitution along the branches of the phylogeny, and the 
    <em>pattern</em> of substitution (relative rates for all pairs of
    nucleotides).</P>

    <P> In this case, the pattern of substitution is assumed to be the same
    for all states, but the rates are allowed to differ.  The model is
    similar to the one proposed by Felsenstein and Churchill (1996).  There
    are <em>k</em> states corresponding to <em>k</em> "rate categories,"
    each of which is defined by a scaling constant that is applied
      uniformly to the branches of the tree.  The transition
    probabilities between states allow for autocorrelation of substitution
    rates---i.e., for adjacent sites to tend to exhibit similar overall
    substitution rates.  A single parameter lambda describes the degree of
    autocorrelation and defines all transition probabilities.
    Here, we have estimated the rate constants from the data, similarly to
    Yang (1995) (see Siepel and Haussler [2003]), but have allowed
    lambda to be treated as a tuning parameter. </P>

    <P> A phylogenetic model was fitted by maximum likelihood to the
    human/mouse/rat alignments using the REV substitution model and the
    discrete gamma model for rate variation (Yang [1994]; <em>k</em>=10 rate
    categories were used).  All sites in the alignments were included in
    the analysis and alignment gaps were treated as missing data.  Branch
    lengths were estimated as follows, in units of expected substitutions
    per site:
      <pre>
      (human:0.193,(mouse:0.076,rat:0.083):0.193)
     </pre>
      (As shown, the tree is arbitrarily rooted at the midpoint of the
      branch between human and the mouse/rat ancestor.)  The shape
      parameter alpha for the discrete gamma model was estimated to have
      value 4.4. Next, a 10-state phylo-HMM was derived from the estimated
      phylogenetic model (with lambda = 0.9), and used to compute the
      posterior probability that each site was "generated" by the state
      having the smallest rate constant.  It is these posterior
      probabilities that are plotted for the track.  Because of the way the
      rate categories are defined, the plotted values can be thought of as
      representing the posterior probability that each site is among the
      10% most conserved sites in the data set, allowing for
      autocorrelation of substitution rates.  </P>

    <P>Currently, gaps are treated as missing data by the phylo-HMM as well
    as in the estimation of the phylogenetic model, which sometimes leads
    to undesirably high posterior probabilities in gappy regions of the
    alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways of improving the
    handling of alignment gaps.</P>
