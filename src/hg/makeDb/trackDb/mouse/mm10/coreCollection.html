<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays biosample-specific candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs)
alongside genome-wide epigenomic signals for the ENCODE Core Collection of 18
ENCODE biosamples that have been fully profiled using four core assays:
DNase-seq, ChIP-seq for the histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27ac,
and ChIP-seq for CTCF binding.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNase-seq identifies regions of <b>open chromatin</b> commonly associated with enhancers,
promoters, and insulators.</li>
<li>ChIP-seq for <b>H3K4me3</b> and <b>H3K27ac</b> marks active and poised promoters and enhancers.</li>
<li><b>CTCF</b> ChIP-seq identifies chromatin loop anchors and insulator elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each subtrack corresponds to an individual experiment in a specific biosample.
These data form the basis for generating biosample-specific annotations of
cCREs, which compose the fifth subtrack for the biosample.</p>
<p>
Additional epigenomic datasets are available at the <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">ENCODE portal</a>, and further exploration
of cCREs and their supporting data is available through the <a target="_blank"
href="https://screen.wenglab.org/">SCREEN web tool</a>, accessible via the
track details page.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configurations</h2>
<p>
Each biosample contains five subtracks (DNase, CTCF, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 signals
and biosample-specific cCREs). Click a specific biosample type and organ/tissue
combination to view available datasets. Epigenomic subtracks can be further
filtered by the signal type.</p>

<p>
Each signal track is colored based on the type of signal.
The cCREs subtrack displays each active cCRE in the corresponding biosample
as a colored box by type

cCREs with low DNase Z-scores in individual biosamples were deemed
to be inactive and displayed as a gray box. The following graphic summarizes
the cCRE classification criteria:</p>

the corresponding element on SCREEN, and the <b>cCRE class</b>.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The DNase-seq data were processed using the <a
href="https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/dnase-seq-encode4/"
target="_blank">ENCODE DNase-seq pipeline</a>, the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq
data were processed using the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/histone-encode4/"
target="_blank">ENCODE histone ChIP-seq pipeline</a>, and the CTCF ChIP-seq data were
processed using the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/transcription-factor-encode4/"
target="_blank">ENCODE transcription factor ChIP-seq pipeline</a>.</p>
<p>
In addition to the cell type-agnostic classification (described in the cCRE Registry track
in this collection), we evaluated the biochemical activity of each cCRE in individual
biosamples using the corresponding biosample-specific DNase, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and CTCF data.
This allowed us to annotate active cCREs in individual biosamples, included as the cCRE
subtrack for each biosample. cCREs with low DNase Z-scores in individual biosamples were
deemed to be inactive and labeled with "Low Chromatin Accessibility."

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
All data is available from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/"
target="_blank">ENCODE data portal</a>.</p>

<p>
The data on the UCSC Genome Browser can be explored interactively with the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored at UCSC in bigWig and bigBed
files that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mm10/encode4/ccre/" target="_blank">our download server</a>.</p>
<p>
The cCREs tracks in this data are found as bigBed files, and the biosignal tracks as bigWig files.
See the <b>Data format</b> link besides the specific data track for a URL to the file on our download
server. Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tools <tt>bigWigToWig</tt>
or <tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tools can also be used to obtain features confined to a given range, e.g.,
<br><br>
<tt>bigWigToBedGraph -chrom=chr1 -start=100000 -end=100500 https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mm10/encode4/ccre/coreCollection/ENCFF325FZS.bw stdout</tt>
<br><br>
or
<br><br>
<tt>bigBedToBed -chrom=chr1 -start=100000 -end=100500 https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mm10/encode4/ccre/coreCollection/ENCFF325FZS_ENCFF396LHC_ENCFF010WPI_ENCFF196GIY.bb stdout</tt></p>
