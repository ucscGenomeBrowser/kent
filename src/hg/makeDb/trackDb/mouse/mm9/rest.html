<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains genome-wide maps of Repressor Element 1-Silencing 
Transcription Factor (REST) binding sites in mouse stem cells, generated 
by the Stem Cell and Developmental Biology Group at the 
Genome Institute of Singapore. 
REST is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates a large 
cohort of neural genes throughout development. Aberrant REST activity 
has been implicated in various disease states, including cancer, epilepsy, 
Huntington's disease and cardiovascular disease.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The ChIP-PET (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to paired-end di-tagging) 
method was used to identify genomic loci occupied by REST. 36 bp PETs 
generated from ChIP DNA fragments enriched for REST binding regions were 
sequenced using the high-throughput 454 sequencing technology. 
REST binding sites were defined as those having at least five overlapping 
PETs (PET5+). Mapping was carried out in two isogenic cell lines: 
the mouse embyronic stem cell E14, and the neural stem cell line NS5. 
The REST binding sites are divided into two categories: 
<UL>
 <LI>ESC and NSC shared sites, "ESC_NSC" (PET5+ in ESC, PET2+ in NSC)
 <LI>ESC-specific sites, "ESC_only" (PET5+ in ESC, PET&lt;2 in NSC)
</UL>
Negligible numbers of NS-only sites were identified. The coordinates 
displayed represent the PET minimal overlap region, defined as the region 
that is overlapped in common by all PETs constituting a cluster.
