<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic region, an mRNA or EST, a chromosomal coordinate
range, or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The
following list shows examples of valid position queries for the
Marmoset genome.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The <em>C. jacchus</em> genome was sequenced to 6X coverage 
using DNA from a female marmoset provided by the Southwestern
National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, TX, USA.
DNA from a full brother of the female was used as the source
for the CHORI-259 BAC library. The combined sequence reads were 
assembled using <A HREF="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/full/13/9/2164"
TARGET=_blank>PCAP</A> and filtered for all known non-marmoset sequence 
contaminants and unscaffolded singleton contigs of less than 2 kb in length. 
This assembly differs from the previous 2.0.1 assembly (which is not featured 
in the UCSC Genome Browser) in that 586 reads containing untrimmed vector 
sequence were removed from contig ends, resulting in 34 contigs less than 2kb 
in length.</P> 
<P>
The 2.0.2 assembly is composed of 49,724 supercontigs containing a total of 
approximately 3.02 billion bases. For more statistics and details
on the assembly process, refer to the WUSTL Callithrix_jacchus-2.0.2
<A HREF="http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Primates/Callithrix_jacchus/assembly/Callithrix_jacchus-2.0.2/ASSEMBLY"
TARGET=_blank>assembly</A> page. </P>
<P>
WUSTL includes the following release notes with this 
assembly: &quot;This preliminary assembly is being made 
available to the community while the assembly continues to 
be refined.  This is a draft assembly with limited quality 
assessment and thus the data is provided &quot;as is&quot;. Once the 
assembly has been quality screened, scaffolded and 
localized by chromosome, they will be submitted to GenBank 
and the various genome browsers.&quot;</P>

initial set of marmoset browser annotation tracks were 
generated by UCSC.  See the
