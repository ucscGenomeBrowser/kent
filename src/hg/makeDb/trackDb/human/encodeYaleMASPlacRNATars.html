<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the locations of forward (+) and reverse (-) strand 
transcriptionally-active regions (TARs)/transcribed fragments 
(transfrags), for human NB4 cell total RNA and for
human placenta Poly(A)+ RNA, hybridized to the Yale 
Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) ENCODE oligonucleotide microarray, 
transcription mapping design #1. This array has 36-mer oligonucleotide probes 
approximately every 36 bp (<em>i.e.</em> end-to-end) covering all the 
non-repetitive DNA sequence of the ENCODE regions ENm001 - ENm012. See 
NCBI GEO accession 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL2105"
TARGET=_blank>GPL2105</A> for details of this array design.</P> 
<P>
These TARs/transfrags are based on a transcript map combining 
hybridization intensities from three biological replicates, each with at 
least two technical replicates. Arrays were hybridized using either
Nimblegen standard protocol, or the protocol described in Bertone 
<em>et al</em>. (2004). The label of each subtrack in this annotation 
indicates the specific protocol used for that particular data set.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
A score was assigned to each oligonucleotide probe position by combining 
two or more technical replicates and by using a sliding window 
approach. Within a sliding window of 160 bp (corresponding to 5 
oligos), the hybridization intensities for all replicates of each 
oligonucleotide probe were compared to their respective array median 
intensity. Within the window and across all the replicates, the number 
of probes above and below their respective median was counted. Using 
the sign test, a one-sided P-value was then calculated and a score 
defined as score=-log(<i>p-value</i>) was assigned to the oligo in the 
center of the window.</P>
<P>
Three independent biological replicates were generated, and each was 
hybridized to at least two different arrays (technical replicates). 
Transcribed regions (TARs/transfrags) were then identified using a score 
threshold of 95th percentile as well as a maximum gap of 80 bp and a 
minimum run of 50 bp (between oligonucleotide positions), effectively 
allowing a gap of one oligo and demanding the TAR/transfrag to 
encompass at least 3 oligos.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Transcribed regions (TARs/transfrags), as determined by individual biological 
samples, were compared to ensure significant overlap.</P>
