<H3> Description </H3>
This track shows Evolutionary Conserved Regions computed by the 
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835645/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Exofish</A> program at <A HREF="http://www.genoscope.cns.fr" TARGET=_BLANK>Genoscope</A>.
Each singleton block corresponds to an "ecore"; two blocks connected by a thin line 
correspond to an "ecotig", a set of colinear ecores in a syntenic region.  

<H3> Methods </H3>
Genome-wide sequence comparisons were done at the protein-coding level between the genome sequences
of human, <I>Homo sapiens</I>, and Tetraodon, <I>Tetraodon nigroviridis</I>, to detect evolutionarily conserved regions (ECORES).
The sequence versions used in the comparison were 
Human (July 2003) and Tetraodon (March 2004).
