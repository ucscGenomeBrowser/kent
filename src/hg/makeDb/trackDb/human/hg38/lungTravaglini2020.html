<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track displays data from <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33208946/" target="_blank"><em>A
molecular cell atlas of the human lung from single-cell RNA
sequencing</em></a>. Using droplet-based and plate-based single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq), 58 lung cell type populations were identified: 
15 epithelial, 9 endothelial, 9 stromal, and 25 immune. This dataset 
covers ~75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and
circulating blood.</p> 

<p>
This track collection contains 19 bar chart tracks of RNA expression in the
human lung where cells are grouped such as by cell type (Lung Cells), tissue
compartments (Lung Compart), detailed cell type (Lung Detail), organ donor
(Lung Donor), halfway detailed cell type (Lung Half Det), sample location (Lung
Locat), or organ (Lung Organ). The default track displayed is Lung Cells.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The cell types are colored by which class they belong to according to the following table.</p>

<p>
<table cellpadding='2'>
  <thead><tr>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Color</th>
    <th style="border-bottom: 2px solid;">Cell classification</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #B05020;"></td><td>fibroblast</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #F01111;"></td><td>immune</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #C000C0;"></td><td>muscle</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0050FF;"></td><td>secretory</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0072D6;"></td><td>ciliated</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #0099C0;"></td><td>epithelial</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: #00C000;"></td><td>endothelial</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Cells that fall into multiple classes will be colored by blending the colors associated
with those classes. The colors will be purest in the Lung Cells subtrack, where 
the bars represent relatively pure cell types. They can give an overview of the
cell composition within other categories in other subtracks as well.</p>


<h2>Method</h2>
<p>
Healthy lung tissue and peripheral blood was surgically removed from 2 male
patients (ages 46 and 75) and 1 female patient (age 51) undergoing lobectomy
for focal lung tumors. Lung tissue was sampled from the bronchi (proximal),
bronchiole (medial), and alveolar (distal) regions. Lung samples were
dissociated and enriched with magnetic columns before being sorted into
epithelial, endothelial/immune, and stromal cell suspensions. Lung and
peripheral blood libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics 3' v2 kit. In
parallel, Smart-Seq2 (SS2) cDNA libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT
library kit. Both 10x and SS2 libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000.</p>

<p>
The cell/gene matrix and cell-level metadata was downloaded from the <a
href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/?ds=stanford-czb-hlca" target="_blank">UCSC Cell Browser</a>. 
The UCSC command line tool matrixClusterColumns, matrixToBarChart, and bedToBigBed
were used to transform these into a bar chart format bigBed file that can be
visualized. The coloring was done by defining colors for the broad level cell
classes and then using another UCSC tool, hcaColorCells, to interpolate the
colors across all cell types. The UCSC tools can be found on our download
server: <a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads"
