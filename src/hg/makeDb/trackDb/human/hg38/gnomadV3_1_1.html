<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The gnomAD v3.1 track shows variants from 76,156 whole genomes (and no exomes), all mapped to the
GRCh38/hg38 reference sequence. 4,454 genomes were added to the number of genomes in the previous
v3 release. For more detailed information on gnomAD v3.1, see the related <a target="_blank"
href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/blog/2020-10-gnomad-v3-1/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>
The gnomAD v3.1.1 track contains the same underlying data as v3.1, but
with minor corrections to the VEP annotations and dbSNP rsIDs. On the UCSC side, we have now
included the mitochondrial chromosome data that was released as part of gnomAD v3.1 (but after
the UCSC version of the track was released). For more information about gnomAD v3.1.1, please
see the related
<a target="_blank" href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2021-03-gnomad-v3-1-1/">changelog</a>.</p>

<p>GnomAD Genome Mutational Constraint is based on v3.1.2 and is available only on hg38. 
It shows the reduced variation caused by purifying
natural selection. This is similar to negative selection on loss-of-function
(LoF) for genes, but can be calculated for non-coding regions too. 
Positive values are red and reflect stronger mutation constraint (and less variation), indicating 
higher natural selection pressure in a region. Negative values are green and 
reflect lower mutation constraint 
(and more variation), indicating less selection pressure and less functional effect.
Briefly, for any 1kbp window in
the genome, a model based on trinucleotide sequence context, base-level
methylation, and regional genomic features predicts expected number of mutations,
and compares this number to the observed number of mutations using a Z-score (see preprint
in the Reference section for details). The chrX scores were added as received from the authors,
as there are no de novo mutation data available on chrX (for estimating the effects of regional 
genomic features on mutation rates), they are more speculative than the ones on the autosomes.</p>

<p>
The gnomAD Predicted Constraint Metrics track contains metrics of pathogenicity per-gene as 
predicted for gnomAD v2.1.1 and identifies genes subject to strong selection against various 
classes of mutation. This includes data on both the gene and transcript level.</p>

<p>
The gnomAD v2 tracks show variants from 125,748 exomes and 15,708 whole genomes, all mapped to
the GRCh37/hg19 reference sequence and lifted to the GRCh38/hg38 assembly. The data originate
from 141,456 unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various population-genetic and
disease-specific <a target="_blank" href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/about">studies</a>
collected by the <a target="_blank"
href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)</a>, release 2.1.1.
Raw data from all studies have been reprocessed through a unified pipeline and jointly
variant-called to increase consistency across projects. For more information on the processing
pipeline and population annotations, see the following <a target="_blank"
href="https://macarthurlab.org/2017/02/27/the-genome-aggregation-database-gnomad">blog post</a>
and the 2.1.1 <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gnomad-public/release/2.1.1/README.txt"
target="_blank">README</a>.</p>
<p>
gnomAD v2 data are based on the GRCh37/hg19 assembly. These tracks display the
GRCh38/hg38 lift-over provided by gnomAD on their downloads site.

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<h3>gnomAD v3.1.1</h3>
<p>
The gnomAD v3.1.1 track version follows the same conventions and configuration as the v3.1 track,
except as noted below.</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a Non-cancer filter used to exclude/include variants from samples of individuals who
were not ascertained for having cancer in a cancer study.
<li>There are additional FILTER field filters: AS_VQSR, indel_stack (chrM only), and npg (chrM only).
<li>Where possible, variants overlapping multiple transcripts/genes have been collapsed into one
variant, with additional information available on the details page, which has roughly halved the
number of items in the bigBed.
<li>The bigBed has been split into two files, one with the information necessary for the track
display, and one with the information necessary for the details page. For more information on
this data format, please see the <a href="#dataAccess">Data Access</a> section below.
<li>The VEP annotation is shown as a table instead of spread across multiple fields.
<li>Intergenic variants have not been pre-filtered.
</ol>

<h3>gnomAD v3.1</h3>
<p>
By default, a maximum of 50,000 variants can be displayed at a time (before applying the filters
described below), before the track switches to dense display mode.
</p>

<p>
Mouse hover on an item will display many details about each variant, including the affected gene(s),
the variant type, and annotation (missense, synonymous, etc).
</p>

<p>
Clicking on an item will display additional details on the variant, including a population frequency
table showing allele count in each sub-population.
</p>

<p>
Following the conventions on the gnomAD browser, items are shaded according to their Annotation
type:
<table class="stdTbl">
    <tr><td>pLoF</td><td width="50px" style="background: rgb(255,32,0)"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Missense</td><td width="50px" style="background: rgb(247,189,0)"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Synonymous</td><td style="background: rgb(4,255,0)"></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Other</td><td style="background: rgb(95,95,95)"></td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h4>Label Options</h4>
<p>
To maintain consistency with the gnomAD website, variants are by default labeled according
to their chromosomal start position followed by the reference and alternate alleles,
for example &quot;chr1-1234-T-CAG&quot;. dbSNP rsID's are also available as an additional
label, if the variant is present in dbSnp.
</p>

<h4>Filtering Options</h4>
<p>
Three filters are available for these tracks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>FILTER: Used to exclude/include variants that failed Random Forest
    (RF), Inbreeding Coefficient (Inbreeding Coeff), or Allele Count (AC0) filters. The
    PASS option is used to include/exclude variants that pass all of the RF,
    InbreedingCoeff, and AC0 filters, as denoted in the original VCF.
    <li>Annotation type: Used to exclude/include variants that are annotated as
    Probability Loss of Function (pLoF), Missense, Synonymous, or Other, as
    annotated by VEP version 85 (GENCODE v19).
    <li>Variant Type: Used to exclude/include variants according to the type of
    variation, as annotated by VEP v85.
</ul>
There is one additional configurable filter on the minimum minor allele frequency.

<h3>gnomAD v2.1.1</h3>
<p>
The gnomAD v2.1.1 track follows the standard display and configuration options available for
<a href="/goldenPath/help/hgVcfTrackHelp.html">VCF tracks</a>, briefly explained below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In <button type="button">dense</button> mode, a vertical line is drawn at the position of
    each variant.</li>
  <li>In <button type="button">pack</button> mode, &quot;ref&quot; and &quot;alt&quot; alleles are
    displayed to the left of a vertical line with colored portions corresponding to allele counts.
    Hovering the mouse pointer over a variant pops up a display of alleles and counts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Filtering Options</h4>
<p>
Four filters are available for these tracks, the same as the underlying VCF:
<ul>
    <li>AC0: Allele Count 0 after filtering out low confidence genotypes (GQ &lt; 20; DP &lt; 10; and AB &lt; 0.2 for het calls))
    <li>InbreedingCoeff: Inbreeding Coefficient &lt; -0.3
    <li>RF: Used to exclude/include variants that failed Random Forest filtering thresholds of 0.055272738028512555, 0.20641025579497013 (probabilities of being a true positive variant) for SNPs, indels)
    <li>Pass: Variant passes all 3 filters
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There are two additional filters available, one for the minimum minor allele frequency, and a configurable filter on the QUAL score.
</p>

<a name="UCSCMethods">
<h2>UCSC Methods</h2>
<p>
The gnomAD v3.1.1 data is unfiltered. </p>
<p>
For the v3.1 update only, in order to cut 
down on the amount of displayed data, the following variant
types have been filtered out, but are still viewable in the gnomAD browser:
<ul>
    <li>Regulatory Region Variants
    <li>Downstream/Upstream Gene Variants
    <li>Transcription Factor Binding Site Variants
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For the full steps used to create the track at UCSC, please see the section
denoted &quot;gnomAD v3.1 update&quot; in the <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/master/src/hg/makeDb/doc/hg38/gnomad.txt"
target="_blank">hg38 makedoc</a>.
</p>

<a name="dataAccess">
<h2>Data Access</h2>

<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a target="_blank" href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">
Table Browser</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. For
automated analysis, the data may be queried from our <a target="_blank"
href="/goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>, and the genome annotations are stored in files that
can be downloaded from our <a
href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/gnomAD/" target="_blank">download server</a>, subject
to the conditions set forth by the gnomAD consortium (see below). Variant VCFs can be found in the
vcf/ subdirectory. The
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/gnomAD/v3.1/variants/">v3.1</a> and
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/gnomAD/v3.1.1/">v3.1.1</a> variants can
be found in a special directory as they have been transformed from the underlying VCF.</p>

<p>
For the v3.1.1 variants in particular, the underlying bigBed only contains enough information
necessary to use the track in the browser. The extra data like VEP annotations and CADD scores are
available in the <a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/gnomAD/v3.1.1/">same directory</a>
as the bigBed but in the files <em>gnomad.v3.1.1.details.tab.gz</em> and
<em>gnomad.v3.1.1.details.tab.gz.gzi</em>. The gnomad.v3.1.1.details.tab.gz contains the gzip
compressed extra data in JSON format, and the .gzi file is available to speed searching of
this data. Each variant has an associated md5sum in the name field of the bigBed which can be
used along with the _dataOffset and _dataLen fields to get the associated external data, as show
below:
<pre>
# find item of interest:
bigBedToBed genomes.bb stdout | head -4 | tail -1
chr1    12416    12417    854246d79dc5d02dcdbd5f5438542b6e    [..omitted for brevity..]    chr1-12417-G-A    67293    902

# use the final two fields, _dataOffset and _dataLen (add one to _dataLen to include a newline), to get the extra data:
bgzip -b 67293 -s 903 gnomad.v3.1.1.details.tab.gz
854246d79dc5d02dcdbd5f5438542b6e    {"DDX11L1": {"cons": ["non_coding_transcript_variant",  [..omitted for brevity..]
</pre>

<p>
The data can also be found directly from the gnomAD <a target="_blank"
href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads">downloads page</a>. Please refer to
our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/soe.ucsc.edu/forum/#!forum/genome"
target="_blank">mailing list archives</a> for questions, or our <a target="_blank"
href="../FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#download36">Data Access FAQ</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The mutational constraints score was updated in October 2022 from a previous,
now deprecated, pre-publication version. The old version can be found in our
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/archive/hg38/gnomad/">archive
directory</a> on the download server. It can be loaded by copying the URL into
our "Custom tracks" input box.</p>
