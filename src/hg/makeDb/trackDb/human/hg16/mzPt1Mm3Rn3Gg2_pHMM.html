<H2>Description</H2> 
<P>
This track shows a measure of evolutionary conservation in $organism, chimp, mouse, 
rat, and chicken based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM).
The following multiz alignments were used to generate the annotation:
<UL>
<LI>$organism $date ($db)
<LI>chimpanzee Nov. 2003 (panTro1)
<LI>mouse Feb. 2003 (mm3)
<LI>rat Jun. 2003 (rn3)
<LI>chicken Feb. 2004 (galGal2) 
</UL></P>
<P>
In &quot;full&quot; visibility mode, this track displays pairwise alignments 
of chimp, mouse, rat, and chicken, each aligned to the $organism genome. The 
pairwise 
alignments are displayed in the standard UCSC browser &quot;dense&quot; mode 
using a greyscale 
density gradient.  The checkboxes in the track configuration section allow
the exclusion of species from the pairwise display; however, this does not
remove them from the conservation score display.  </P>
<P>
When zoomed-in to the base-display level, the track shows the base 
composition of each alignment. The numbers and symbols on the Gaps
line indicate the lengths of gaps in the $organism sequence at those 
alignment positions relative to the longest non-$organism sequence. If the gap 
size is greater than 9, a non-numeric symbol is shown: a &quot;*&quot if the 
gap size is a multiple of 3; otherwise &quot;+&quot;. 
To view detailed information about the alignments at a specific position,
zoom in the display to 30,000 or fewer bases, then click on the alignment.</P>
<P>
This track may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects
of the displayed information. Click the

configuration help</A> link for an explanation of the configuration options.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P> 
Best-in-genome blastz pairwise alignments of $organism-mouse and
$organism-rat were multiply aligned using a program called humor
(HUman-MOuse-Rat), which is a special variant of the <em>Multiz</em>
program.  Multiz was used first to align the humor results with
reciprocal best $organism-chimp alignments, and then to align the 
$organism-chimp-mouse-rat multiple alignment with best-in-genome blastz 
$organism-chicken alignments.  The resulting
$organism-chimp-mouse-rat-chicken multiple alignments were then assigned 
conservation scores by phylo-HMM.</P>
<P>
A phylo-HMM is a probabilistic model that describes both the process
of DNA substitution at each site in a genome, and the way this process
changes from one site to the next (Felsenstein and Churchill 1996,
Yang 1995, Siepel and Haussler 2003, Siepel and Haussler 2004).  
A phylo-HMM can be thought
of as a machine that generates a multiple alignment, in the same way
that an ordinary hidden Markov model (HMM) generates an individual
sequence.  While the states of an ordinary HMM are associated with
simple multinomial probability distributions, the states of a
phylo-HMM are associated with more complex distributions defined by
probabilistic phylogenetic models.  These distributions can capture
differences in the rates and patterns of nucleotide
substitution observed in different types of genomic regions (e.g., coding
or noncoding regions, conserved or nonconserved regions).</P>
<P> 
<img src="/images/fels-church.jpg" border="1"
align="right"> To compute a conservation score, we use a
<em>k</em>-state phylo-HMM, whose <em>k</em> associated phylogenetic
models differ only in overall evolutionary rate (Felsenstein and
Churchill 1996, Yang 1995). In the image at right, there are three
<EM>k</EM> states, 
S<SUB>1</SUB>, S<SUB>2</SUB>, and S<SUB>3</SUB>, but in practice we 
use <EM>k</EM> = 10.  
A phylogenetic model is estimated globally, using the discrete gamma model
for rate variation (Yang 1994), then a scaled version of the estimated model
is associated with each state in a phylo-HMM. There is a
separate &quot;rate constant&quot;, <em>r<sub>i</sub></em>, for each state i, 
which is multiplied by all branch lengths in the globally estimated model.
The transition probabilities between states allow for autocorrelation of
substitution rates, i.e., for adjacent sites to tend to exhibit similar
overall substitution rates.  A single parameter, lambda, describes the
degree of autocorrelation and defines all transition probabilities.  
Here, we have estimated the rate constants from the data,
similarly to Yang (1995) (Siepel and Haussler 2003), but have
allowed lambda to be treated as a tuning parameter.  For the
conservation score, we use the posterior probability that each site was
"generated" by the state having the smallest rate constant.  Because of
the way the rate categories are defined, the plotted values can be
thought of as approximately representing the posterior probability that
each site is among the 10% most conserved sites in the data set
(allowing for autocorrelation of substitution rates).  </P>
<P> 
In this case, the general reversible (REV) substitution model was
used in parameter estimation, and lambda was set to 0.9.  Alignment
gaps were treated as missing data, which sometimes has the effect of
producing undesirably high posterior probabilities in gappy regions of
the alignment.  We are looking at several possible ways of improving
the handling of alignment gaps.</P>
