<H2> Methods </H2>

<P>
<B>Eddy-tRNAscanSE      (tRNA genes, Sean Eddy): </B><BR>
       tRNAscan-SE 1.23 with default parameters.
       Score field contains tRNAscan-SE bit score; >20 is good, >50 is great.
</P>
<P>    
<B>  Eddy-BLAST-tRNAlib   (tRNA pseudogenes, Sean Eddy): </B><BR>
       Wublast 2.0, with options &quot;-kap wordmask=seg B=50000 
       W=8 cpus=1&quot;.
       Score field contains % identity in blast-aligned region.
       Used each of 602 tRNAs and pseudogenes predicted by tRNAscan-SE
       in the human oo27 assembly as queries. Kept all nonoverlapping
       regions that hit one or more of these with P <= 0.001.</P>
<P>  
<B>  Eddy-BLAST-snornalib (known snoRNAs and snoRNA pseudogenes, Steve Johnson): </B><BR>
       Wublastn 2.0, with options &quot;-V=25 -hspmax=5000 -kap wordmask=seg 
       B=5000 W=8 cpus=1&quot;.
       Score field contains blast score.
       Used each of 104 unique snoRNAs in snorna.lib as a query.
       Any hit >=95% full length and >=90% identity is annotated as a
       &quot;true gene&quot;.
       Any other hit with P <= 0.001 is annotated as a &quot;related 
       sequence&quot; and interpreted as a putative pseudogene.</P>
<P>   
<B>  Eddy-BLAST-otherrnalib 
       (non-tRNA, non-snoRNA noncoding RNAs with GenBank entries
        for the human gene.):</B><BR>
       Wublastn 2.0 [15 Apr 2002]
         with options: &quot;-kap -cpus=1 -wordmask=seg -W=8 -E=0.01 -hspmax=0
                       -B=50000 -Z=3000000000&quot;.   Exceptions to this are:
       <UL>
       <LI>        Large ncRNAs (LSU & SSU rRNA, H19, Xist):
                   change &quot;-W=11&quot;; addition &quot;-maskextra=50&quot;.
                   Xist contains repetitive elements and was masked with
                   RepeatMasker, Library version 6.8. </LI>
       <LI>        microRNAs:
                   &quot;-kap -cpus=1 -S=70 -hspmax=0 -B=100&quot; replaces all 
                   above parameters. </LI>
       </UL></P>
<P>
       The score field contains the blastn score. 
       41 unique miRNAs and 29 other ncRNAs were used as queries.
       Any hit >=95% full length and >=95% identity is annotated as a 
       &quot;true gene&quot;.
       Any other hit with P <= 0.001 and >= 65% identity is annotated
       as a &quot;related sequence&quot;. There is an exception to this: 
       all miRNAs consist of 16-26 bp sequences in GenBank 
       and are annotated only if they are 100% full length and have 
       100% identity. The set of miRNAs used consists of Let-7 from 
       Pasquinelli et al. (2000) and 40 miRNAs from Mourelatos et al. (2002), 
       as mentioned in the references section below.
