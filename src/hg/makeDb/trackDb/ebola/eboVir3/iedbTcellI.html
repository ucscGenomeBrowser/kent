<H2>Description</H2>
<p>
This track shows protein sequences displayed by virus-infected cells to T-cells
as annotated by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 
<a href="http://www.iedb.org/" target="_blank">Immune Epitope Database</a> (IEDB). 
Only sequences with a positive assay outcome are shown on the track. All fields annotated by
IEDB and exported in their &quot;compact&quot; file are shown on the details page, which also 
provides links back to the IEDB.  </p>

</p>

<p>
To enrich for MHC Class I epitopes, this track shows epitopes with annotated
Class I alleles or, if the allele was not annotated, alleles with less than or
equal to 12 amino acids.  </p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
Matching peptide sequences are shown. Mouse over the features to see the
exact MHC allele, if annotated.
