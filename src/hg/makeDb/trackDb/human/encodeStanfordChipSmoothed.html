<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin IP was performed as described in Trinklein <em>et
al</em>. (2004).  Amplified and labeled ChIP DNA was hybridized to
oligo tiling arrays produced by NimbleGen along with a total genomic
reference sample.  The data for each array were median subtracted (log
2 ratios) and normalized (divided by the standard deviation).</P>
<P>
The transformed mean ratios of ChIP DNA:Total DNA for 
all probes were then smoothed by calculating a sliding-window mean.  
Windows of six neighboring probes (sliding two probes at a time) were 
used; within each window, the highest and lowest value were dropped, 
and the remaining 4 values were averaged.  To increase the 
contrast between high and low values for visual display, the average 
was converted to a score by the formula: <BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
score = 8^(average) * 10</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>.
These scores are for visualization purposes; for all analyses, 
the raw ratios, which are available in the Stanf ChIP track, should be used. 
</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were
performed.  The Myers lab is currently testing the specificity and
sensitivity using real-time PCR.</P>
