<P>
The Genetic Association Database (GAD) is intended for use primarily by 
medical scientists and other professionals concerned with genetic disorders, 
by genetics researchers, and by advanced students in science 
and medicine. While the GAD database is open to the public, 
users seeking information about a personal medical or 
genetic condition are urged to consult with a qualified 
physician for diagnosis and for answers to personal questions.
These data are provided by the GAD
and do not represent any additional curation by UCSC.</P>

<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/" TARGET=_BLANK>
Genetic Association Database</A> is an archive of human genetic 
association studies of complex diseases and disorders. The goal 
of the database is to allow the user to rapidly identify medically 
relevant polymorphism from the large volume of polymorphism and 
mutational data, in the context of standardized nomenclature.
</P>
<P>If the track is displayed in &quot;pack&quot; or &quot;full&quot; mode, 
mousing over an entry of this track will show a pop-up message listing all 
associated diseases.  
In &quot;full&quot; mode, each feature is labeled with the associated disease 
class code (as defined below).

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Study data are recorded in the context of official human gene 
nomenclature with additional molecular reference numbers and links. The data
are gene-centered; that is, each record is based on a gene or marker. 
For example, if a study investigated six genes for a particular disorder, 
there will be six records. Gene information is standardized and annotated with 
molecular information, enabling integration with other molecular and genomic 
data resources.
</P>

<H2>Data</H2>
<P>
Data are added to GAD on a periodic
basis by the curator or investigators. A majority of the records in GAD
are extracted from the online 
<A HREF="http://www.hugenavigator.net/" target=_blank>HuGE Navigator 
database</A>, which is sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.  HuGE Navigator
provides access to a continuously updated, curated knowledge base of
gene-disease associations, meta-analyses, and related information on genes
and diseases extracted from NCBI PubMed. A gene-centered view is available via
<A HREF="http://www.hugenavigator.net/HuGENavigator/startPagePedia.do" 
target=_blank>Genopedia</A>, which is also available as a custom track that 
can be loaded in the NCBI36/hg18 (Mar. 2006 assembly) Genome Browser.
