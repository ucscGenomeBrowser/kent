<H2>Description and Methods </H2>
<P>
This track shows gene annotations from the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (Vega)
database. Annotations are divided into two subtracks: Vega Protein Coding 
Annotations and Vega Annotated Pseudogenes and Immunoglobulin Segments from
the <A HREF="http://vega.sanger.ac.uk/Homo_sapiens/index.html" 
TARGET=_BLANK>Vega Human Genome Annotation</A> project.</P>

The following information is an excerpt from the

Vertebrate Genome Annotation</A> home page:</P>
<P>
&quot;The Vega database
is designed to be a central repository for high-quality, frequently updated
manual annotation of different vertebrate finished genome sequence.
Vega attempts to present consistent high-quality curation of the published
chromosome sequences. Finished genomic sequence is analysed on a
clone-by-clone basis using
a combination of similarity searches against DNA and protein databases
as well as a series of <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions (GENSCAN, Fgenes).
The annotation is based on supporting evidence only.&quot;</P>
<P>
&quot;In addition, comparative analysis using vertebrate datasets such as
the Riken mouse cDNAs and Genoscope <em>Tetraodon nigroviridis</em> Ecores
(Evolutionary Conserved Regions) are used for novel gene discovery.&quot;</P>
