<P>
This track shows the whole genome shotgun (WGS) contigs of the March 2006 
$organism Zv6 assembly from
<A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio/Zv6_assembly_information.shtml" TARGET=_blank>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</A>.
<P>
Following the assembly of sequence to WGS contigs, contigs were mapped to 
scaffolds (supercontigs). A fingerprinted contigs (FPC) map was produced by 
restriction enzyme digestion with HindIII. Clones were selected from this for 
high quality sequencing. To create the Zv6 assembly, the scaffolds were tied 
to this FPC map. The chrFinished scaffolds from the Zv3 assembly (danRer1) have been placed on chromosomes since the Zv4 assembly (danRer2). For more 
information about the assembly, see the assembly track description and the 
Danio rerio Sequencing Project page at Sanger.

<P>
The assembly contains 6,653 scaffolds having an N50 length of 1,247 kb 
(n = 327). Of these, a total of 2,966 scaffolds are in the unordered 
chromosomes: 68 in chrUn_random, and 2,898 in chrNA.

The Zv6 Zebrafish assembly was produced by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute,
in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, 
the Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory),
and Yi Zhou, Anthony DiBiase and Leonard Zon from the Boston Children's 
Hospital.
