<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track displays regions showing evidence for conservation with respect 
to mutations involving sequence insertions and deletions (indels).
These “indel-purified sequences” (IPSs) were obtained by comparing the 
predictions of a neutral model of indel evolution with data obtained from 
human (hg18), mouse (mm8) and dog (camFam2) alignments (Lunter <I>et al</I>., 2006)
The evidence for conservation is statistical, and each region is annotated 
with a posterior probability.  It may be interpreted as the probability that 
the segment shows the paucity of indels by selection, rather than by random 
chance.
Apart from the underlying alignment, these data are independent of the 
conservation of the nucleotide sequence itself.  Any inferred conservation 
of the sequence, e.g. as shown by phastCons, is therefore independent evidence 
for selection. It may happen that sequence is conserved with respect to 
indel mutations without concomitant evidence of conservation of the 
nucleotide sequence. The opposite may also happen.

The score (based on the false discovery rate, FDR) is reflected in the 
bluescale density gradient coloring the track items. Lighter colours reflect a 
higher FDR.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
In the absence of selection, indels have a certain predicted distribution 
over the genome.  The actual distribution shows an over-abundance of ungapped 
regions, due to selection purifying functional sequence from the deleterious 
effects of indels.  Neutrally evolving sequence, such as (by and large) 
ancestral repeats, show an exceedingly good fit to the neutral predictions.  
This accurate fit allows the identification of a good proportion of conserved 
sequence at a relatively low false discovery rate (FDR).  For example, at 
an FDR of 10%, the predicted sensitivity is 75%.
Each identified indel-purified sequence (IPS) is annotated by two numbers: a 
false discovery rate (FDR), and a posterior probability (p).  
The FDR refers to a set of segments, not a given segment by itself.  In this 
case, it refers to the minimum FDR of all sets that include the segment of 
interest.  For example, a segment annotated with a 10% FDR also belongs to a 
set with a 15% FDR, but not a set with a 5% FDR.
The posterior probability does refer to the single segment by itself.  It has 
a frequentist interpretation, namely, as the proportion of regions, annotated 
with the same posterior probability, that have been under purifying selection, 
rather than showing the observed lack of indels by random chance.
The data include segments for a false-discovery rate of up to 50%.  The 
score directly reflects the FDR, through the following formula:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>
score = 90 / (FDR + 0.08)</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

This maps FDR 1% (the most restrictive category) to 999, and FDR 10% to 500.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
The neutral indel model was calibrated using ancestral repeats, against which 
it showed an excellent fit.  Among the identified IPSs at 10% FDR and 
predicted sensitivity of 75%, we found 75% of annotated protein-coding 
exons (weighted by length), and 75% of the 222 microRNAs that were 
annotated at the time.  Ancestral repeats were heavily depleted among the 
identified segments.</P>
