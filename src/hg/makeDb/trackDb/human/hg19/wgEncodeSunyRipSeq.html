<H2>Description</H2>
<P>The RNA binding protein (RBP) associated mRNA sequencing track (RIP-Seq) is produced as part of the <A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>.
This track displays transcriptional fragments associated with RBP in 
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A> K562 and GM12878,
using Ribonomic profiling via Illumina SBS.
</P>

<P>In eukaryotic organisms gene regulatory networks require an additional
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However,
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns.
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Seq profiling.
</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>This track is a multi-view composite track. For each view there
are multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines.
</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><i>Peaks</i>
<DD>The Peaks view shows the genomic extent of the sequencing read peaks.
<P>
<DT><I>Signal</I>
<DD>Density graph of signal enrichment based on a normalized aligned read density (Read Per Million, RPM).  RPM is reported in the score field and is equal to the number of reads at that position divided by the total number of reads divided by one million.  The Signal view is unflitered and displays dense, continuous data as a graph and the RPM measure assists in visualizing the relative amount of a given transcript across multiple samples.</DD>
<P>
<DT><I>Alignments</I>
<DD>The Alignments view shows reads mapped to the genome.
The alignment file follows the standard SAM format of Bowtie output. 
See the <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#sam-bowtie-output" target=_blank>Bowtie Manual</a> for more information about the SAM Bowtie output and the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf#page=4" target=_blank>SAM Format Specification</a> for more information on the SAM/BAM file format.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell">ENCODE cell culture protocols </A>.
RNA samples were amplified and converted to cDNA with the <A HREF="http://www.nugeninc.com">Nugen</A> Ovation&#169; RNA-Seq System and prepped for sequencing with the
<A HREF="http://www.illumina.com">Illumina</A> mRNA-Seq protocol.  

Approximately 30 million single end sequencing reads were obtained for each K562 and GM12878.
RIP samples were analyzed for signal that was at or above the 60th percentile and statistically enriched compared to the negative control.
Sequences were analyzed using <A HREF="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/">TopHat</A> (Trapnell <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009) with 
<A HREF="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">Bowtie</A> (Langmead <EM>et al.</EM>, 2009).
</P>
<P>
Peaks were called from the top 40&#37; of TopHat normalized reads,
with a max gap,  min run of (24:48).
Unions of overlapping peak regions from total RNA replicates (RIP-Input) are presented with p-value 
from a one tailed t-test for average signal from replicates versus 0 
(no cut-off was used for totals). Replicate overlap for positive RIP treatment peaks (ELAVL1 and PABPC1)  
are presented with a p-value from one tailed t-test versus signal for same the region in negative 
control replicates (T7-tag). RIP peaks were from sequences longer than 120 bp and p-value &lt; .05.
For both totals (RIP-input) and RIPs, the peak scores are scaled relative p-values between treatment and control.
