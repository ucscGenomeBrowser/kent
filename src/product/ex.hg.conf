# db.host is the name of the MySQL host to connect to
#  high-volume sites will want a separate database server from the web server
db.host=localhost
# db.user is the username is use when connecting to the specified db.host
#	it needs read-only access.  The browser CGIs do not need
#	read-write access to the database tables
db.user=readonly
# db.password is the password to use with the specified db.user
db.password=access

# if your MySQL system is configured for a different socket connection,
# use the following variables to override the MySQL defaults:
# db.socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
# db.port=3306
# *!# NOTE: the port override will only work when host is *not* localhost
#	when localhost is used, MySQL may connect via shared memory
#	connections and not via TCP/IP socket ports

# slow-db is the name of a MySQL host to fallback to if a query failed 
# on db.host. This means that tables can be dropped from db.host as long as
# they are present on slow-db.
#slow-db.host=genome-mysql.soe.ucsc.edu
#slow-db.user=genomep
#slow-db.password=password

# If the slow-db host is too far away, a table on db.host with schema information
# of the slow-db databases will speed up most tracks. The table is created with
# the command "makeTableList" and its name is specified here
# showTableList=tableList

# If your mysql server is configured to reject the option LOCAL in the command
# LOAD DATA INFILE (e.g. in OpenSuse) then you can force the browser to never
# use the LOCAL option.  Note that for this to work, you have to keep all you
# mysql servers on the same machine as the CGIs and these servers must have
# file permissions and any security infrastructure like SELinux or AppArmor
# setup in a way that allows them to read temporary files that the CGIs
# (hgCustom, the custom track loaders) create 
# db.neverLocal=1

# if you want a different default species selection on the Gateway
# page, change this default Human to one of the genomes from the
#	defaultDb table in hgcentral:
#	hgsql -e "select genome from defaultDb;" hgcentral
# If you need a different version of that specific genome, change
#	the defaultDb table entry, for example, a different mouse genome
#	version as default:
#	hgsql -e 'update defaultDb set name="mm8" where genome="Mouse"
#	then this defaultGenome would read: defaultGenome=Mouse
# 
defaultGenome=Human

# tracks display width has a default maximum width of 5000 pixels
# override that limit with a larger number for maxDisplayPixelWidth
# maxDisplayPixelWidth=5000

# trackDb table to use. A simple value of `trackDb' is normally sufficient.
# In general, the value is a comma-separated list of trackDb format tables to
# search.  This supports local tracks combined with a mirror of the trackDb
# table from UCSC. The names should be in the form `trackDb_suffix'. This
# implies a parallel hgFindSpec format search table exists in the form
# hgFindSpec_suffix.  The specified trackDb tables are searched in the order
# specified, with the first occurrence of a track being used.  You may associate
# trackDb/hgFindSpec tables with other instances of genome databases using a
# specification of dbProfile:trackDbTbl, where dbProfile is the name of a
# databases profile in hg.conf, and trackDbTbl is the name of the table in the
# remote databases.  See below for details of dbProfile
# 
db.trackDb=trackDb
#db.trackDb=trackDb_local,trackDb
#db.trackDb=trackDb,someDbProfile:trackDb

# track group table definitions.  This is a comma-seperate list similar to
# db.trackDb that defines the track group tables.  Database profiles 
# may alow be included using the syntax dbProfile:grpTbl.

#  New browser function as of June 2012:
#
#  The UCSC genome browser is using new hgLogin CGI to replace 
#  sign-in service provided by genomewiki previously. 
#
# To maintain backward compatibility, the hgLogin CGI 
# reuse most of the genomewiki related configuration parameters such as 
# host and cookie names. This design make transition from genomewiki 
# to hgLogin transparent. For current mirror sites with sign-in function
# (via a simulated- or locally-installed mediawiki server), as long as
# hgLogin is not enabled, all browser functions and current sign-in 
# functions will work as before. Please refer to 
#
# http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Enabling_hgLogin
#
# for more details.
#
#  To enable the hgLogin function, set the following 8 parameters as 
#  described below:
#  login.systemName:  must be set to some name to enable hgLogin CGI.
#  wiki.host:  should be set to the host that running the hgLogin CGI.
#              The host should be in the same domain as value set in 
#              "central.domain".  
#              The special value HTTPHOST for wiki.host will use the 
#              server hostname as supplied by the http request. This allows
#              login to work if a server is reached under different names.
#              The default value HTTPHOST should work in all contexts.
#  Set the values of the two cookies to value exactly the same as below. 

# required to use hgLogin
login.systemName=hgLogin CGI
# url to server hosting hgLogin
wiki.host=HTTPHOST
# Arbitrary name of cookie holding user name 
wiki.userNameCookie=myLabCookieNameForUserName
# Arbitrary name of cookie holding user id 
wiki.loggedInCookie=myLabCookieNameForUseID

# The following 4 parameters are used for UI headings (browserName) and 
# necessary text string used in emails send out to user.
# You should set them to any appropriate local values.  

# title of host of browser, this text be shown in the user interface of
# the login/sign up screens
login.browserName=myLab Genome Browser
# base url of browser installed
login.browserAddr=http://mylab.university.edu
# signature written at the bottom of hgLogin system emails
login.mailSignature=My Lab browser administrator
# from/return email address used for system emails
# or NOEMAIL to skip the email confirmation
login.mailReturnAddr=browserAdministrator@mylab.university.edu

# If login is enabled, then the server should be configured to support HTTPS.
# HTTPS is used for hgLogin by default.  If the server cannot support HTTPS
# but login is still enabled (not recommended), HTTPS for hgLogin can be
# disabled by uncommenting this setting:
#login.https=off

# if https is on, the user login (hgLogin) redirects the user to https.
# To do this, it has to use an absolute link that starts with https and the server
# name. In certain circumstances, this is not needed, e.g. when the genome browser
# is always using https anyways. If the genome browser runs behind a reverse
# proxy, this does not work at all, as the CGI does not know that the connection is 
# already using HTTPs. In these cases, the following statement will not try to
# redirect to HTTPS but just use a normal, relative link during/after the login
#login.relativeLink=on

# If you do not want to use our hgLogin but want to use HTTP Basic Authentication
# (e.g. if you have usernames in an htpasswd file or want to use mod_auth_ldap and
# validate users against an LDAP server), then you can activate this here.
# login.basicAuth=on

# Secret text string (like password) for generating and validating secure login key:
login.cookieSalt=longSecretTextString

# The following 6 parameters are used to set up your browser to accept user suggestions.
# After a user submits a suggestion, both the user and the suggestion admin address below
# will receive an email containing the suggestion.
# email address for the suggestion admin

#  New browser function as of March 2007, allowing saved genome browser
#	sessions into genomewiki.  These Cookie names depend upon how
#	your wiki is configured.  The wiki system constructs the cookie
#	names from its own variables $wgDBname and $wgDBprefix
#	You can find these in your LocalSettings.php, if $wgDbprefix
#	is not null the cookie name is: $wgDBname_$wgDBprefix_UserName
#	if wgDbprefix is null then simply: $wgDBname_UserName
#	same pattern for _UserID and __session below
#	The example here is for $wgDBName=wikidb and $wgDBprefix=mw1
# wiki.host=genomewiki.ucsc.edu
# wiki.userNameCookie=wikidb_mw1_UserName
# wiki.loggedInCookie=wikidb_mw1_UserID
#	You will need to create the namedSessionDb table in your hgcentral db:

#  New browser function as of April 2007, custom track data is kept
#	in a database instead of in trash files.  This function requires
#	several other factors to be in place before it will work.
#  This was an optional feature for quite some time in 2007 and 2008,
#	but it is now mandatory.  The older file-based trash system will
#	appear to work, but it does not operate properly, and can not
#	operate some of the newer types of custom tracks.

##
# Database profiles
##
#   The dbProfile facility provides a limited mechanism for access tracks from
# multiple database servers.  This is particularly useful when a mirror server
# contains the majority of the track data needs to be shared by multiple
# groups with a small number of locally produced tracks that they the need to
# keep isolated from the other groups.  A dbProfile associates a MySQL host,
# user, and password with a dbProfile name.  To define a dbProfile named
# myProfile, define the hg.conf variables:
#
#    myProfile.host
#    myProfile.user
#    myProfile.password
#
# The default profile is named `db', and is defined by the `db.*' variables
# described above.  The `customTracks.*' and `central.*' variables also define
# profiles.
#
# Profiles can be associated with an entire genome databases or some types of
# tables.  To associate database myGenome with myProfile, define the
# variable:
#     myGenome.profile=myProfile
#
# A dbProfile may be associated with a trackDb/hgFindSpec table pair or a grp
# table as described in the `db.trackDb' and `db.grp' variables above.  To
# associate a particular track table, specify the "dbProfile" setting in the
# trackDb entry:
#
#    track myTrack
#    ...
#    dbProfile myProfile
#
# Note that dbProfile only works on a small number of track types and is not
# well tested.  In general, the dbProfile facility has not been widely use and
# may still contain bugs.  The recommended approach for setting up a
# remote/local server pair is to use the default profile for the remote server
# with the majority of tracks, and use a non-default profile for local tracks
# and trackDb tables.  A common configuration would be:

#db.host=oursharedhost
#db.user=readonly
#db.password=access
#
#myStuff.host=localhost
#myStuff.user=readonly
#myStuff.password=access
#
#db.trackDb=myStuff:trackDb,trackDb
