<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track contains SNPs from personal genomes that have been made
publicly available.
</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
The alleles in the the details page are what is found on the plus strand.  
What is shown in the browser adjusts to the requested view, complementing 
and or reversing the nucleotides as needed.  
</P>
<P>
The frequency shown by box color, mouse overs, and on 
the details page is the read frequency of the alleles.

Craig Venter
<DD>
 An overview is given
<A HREF="http://www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/huref/overview/" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
This subtrack contains Venter's SNPs from the file HuRef.InternalHuRef-NCBI.gff.
This was filtered for method 1 SNPs only, and any SNPs that had N as an allele
were also filtered out.  
<DT>
James Watson
<DD>
These SNPs came from the file: watson_snp.gff.gz under the bulk JW
polymorphisms. <BR>
