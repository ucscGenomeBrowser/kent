<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a
sequenced genomic region, an mRNA or EST, a chromosomal coordinate
range, or keywords from the GenBank description of an mRNA. The
following list shows examples of valid position queries for the
orangutan genome.  See the

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The <em>Pongo pygmaeus abelii</em> assembly (6X coverage) consists of whole 
genome shotgun data from primary donor-derived reads obtained from 
&quot;Susie&quot;, a female Sumatran orangutan housed at the Gladys Porter Zoo 
in Brownsville, TX.
The combined sequence reads were assembled using the PCAP software (Huang, 
2003) and filtered for all known non-orangutan sequence 
contaminants using stringent parameters derived by eliminating detectable
global mis-assemblies larger than 50 kb. Mis-assemblies (interchromosomal 
cross-overs) were determined by aligning the orangutan genome against the 
human genome. 
Sequences were obtained from plasmids, fosmids, and BAC-end
sequences from CHORI-276, also obtained from &quot;Susie&quot;. A fingerprint
map with a target of 12X clone coverage is currently in progress.
</P>
<P>
The assembly data were aligned against the human genome at UCSC
(B. Raney) using BLASTZ (Schwartz, 2003) to align and score
non-repetitive orangutan regions against repeat-masked human
sequence. The alignment chains differentiated between orthologous and
paralogous alignments (Kent, 2003), and only &quot;reciprocal best&quot;
alignments were retained in the final alignment set. The orangutan AGP files
were generated from these alignments in a manner similar to that
already described (The Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing and Analysis
Consortium, 2005). Documented inversions based primarily on FISH data
(Rocchi, personal communication) as well as inversions suggested by the
assembly and supported by additional mapping data (e.g. fosmid end
sequences against the human assembly, (Chen and Eichler, personal
communication)) were introduced. The alignments to human chromosome 2 were
separated into organutan chromosomes 2A and 2B.  Finally, 78
finished BAC (CHORI-273) clones were integrated into the final
chromosomal sequences.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3.09 Gb of total sequence, 3.08 Gb are ordered and oriented along
the chromosomes. Gap sizes between supercontigs were estimated based on
their size in human, with a maximum gap size of 30 kb allowed.

the virtual chromosome &quot;chrM&quot;. For more information about this
