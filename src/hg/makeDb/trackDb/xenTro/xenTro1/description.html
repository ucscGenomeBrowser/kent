The October 2004 frog (<em>Xenopus tropicalis</em>) whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly release version 3.0
was sequenced and assembled by the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a sequenced 
genomic clone, an mRNA or EST,
a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides examples 
of various types of position queries for the dog genome. See the

<H3>Assembly Details</H3>
<P>
The dog genome contains approximately 2.5 billion base pairs. 
This sequence is based on 7.6X coverage of the dog genome, assuming a WGS
assembly size of 2.4 Gb. The assembly has an N50 contig length of 123 kb and 
an N50 supercontig length of 41.6 Mb.
The boxer breed was selected for the initial sequencing effort based on the
lower variation rate in its genome relative to other breeds. For more
information about this assembly, see the 
<A HREF="http://www.genome.gov/12511476" TARGET=_blank>NHGRI press release</A>.
<P>
