Specification of the Multiple Alignment Format (.maf) v1

Introduction

The multiple alignment format stores a series of multiple
alignments in a format that is easy to parse and relatively
easy to read.  We apologize for creating yet another
multiple alignment format.  We realize that there are
many in existence.  What motivates this format is
to store multiple alignments at the dna level between
entire genomes. The existing formats we are aware of
are geared towards multiple alignments of single proteins,
and would require considerable extension at the least to
cope with genomic issues such as forward and reverse
strand directions,  multiple pieces to the alignment,
and so forth.

A Simple Example

Here is a simple example of a file with two alignments
with three sequences each:

##maf version=1 scoring=probability
#mblastz 8.91 02-Jan-2005

a score=0.128
s human_hoxa 100  9 + 100257 ACA-TTACTA
s horse_hoxa 120 10 -  98892 ACAATTGCTA
s fugu_hoxa   88  8  + 90788 ACA--TGCTA

a score=0.071
s human_unc 9077 8 + 10998 ACAGTATT
s horse_unc 4555 6 -  5099 ACA--ATT
s fugu_unc  4000 4 +  4038 AC----TT


General Structure

The .maf format is line oriented. Multiple alignments each
end with a blank line.  Each sequence in an alignment 
is on a single line, which can get quite long. Words in
a line are delimited by any white space. Lines 
starting with # are considered comments.  Lines starting 
with ## can be ignored by most programs, but contain 
meta-data of one form or another.  

The file is broken into paragraphs that terminate in a
blank line.  Within a paragraph the first word of a line
indicates it's type.  Each multiple alignment is in 
a paragraph by itself that begins with an 'a' line and
which contains an 's' line for each sequence in the
multiple alignment.  Parsers for now should ignore
other types of paragraphs, and other types of lines within
an alignment paragraph. Parsers should also ignore extra
blank lines before paragraphs.


The First Line

The first line of a .maf file begins with ##maf.  This
word is followed by whitespace separated variable=value pairs.  
There must *not* be white space surrounding the =.
The currently defined variables are:
   version - Required.  Currently set to one.
   scoring - Optional. A name for the scoring scheme used for the
             alignments.  The current scoring schemes are:
	bit - roughly corresponds to blast bit values - roughly
	      2 points per aligning base minus penalties for mismatches
	      and inserts.
	blastz - blastz scoring scheme - roughly 100 points per aligning
	      base.
	probability - some score normalized between 0 and 1.
   program - Optional. Name of program generating alignment.
Parsers ignore variables they do not understand.

'a' Lines

Each alignment begins with an 'a' line.  The 'a' is followed
by name=value pairs.   There are no required name=value pairs.
The currently defined variables are:
    score - Optional. Floating point score. If this is present
            it is good practice to also define scoring in the first 
	    line.
    pass - Optional.  Positive integer value.  For programs that
           do multiple pass alignments such as blastz,
	   this shows which pass this alignment came from.
	   Typically the pass 1 will find the strongest alignments
	   genome-wide,  and pass 2 will find weaker alignments
	   between two first pass alignments.


's' Lines    

The s lines together with the a lines define a multiple alignment.
The s lines have the following fields which are defined by 
position rather than name=value pairs. 

  src - The name of one of the source sequences for the alignment.
        Typically this will be the first word following the '>' in
	a fasta file that was input to the multiple aligner.
  start - The start of the aligning region in the source sequence.
        This is a zero based number. If the strand field below is
	'-' then this is the start relative to the reverse-complemented
	source sequence.
  size - The size of the aligning region in the source sequence.  This
         number is equal to the number of non-dash characters in the
	 alignment text field below.
  strand - Either '+' or '-'.  If '-' then the alignment is to the
         reverse complemented source.
  srcSize - The size of the entire source sequence, not just the parts
         involved in the alignment.
  text - The bases (or amino acids) in the alignment and any dashes
         as well.


'i' Lines

The i lines are optional.  They are used by the browser to display synteny
breaks. An i line must immediately follow the s line that it describes
(unless there is no s line for that species in the current block).
The i lines have the following fields which are defined by 
position rather than name=value pairs. 
    src - The name of one of the source sequences for the alignment.
	    This should match the s line above the i line.
    leftStatus - the syntenic status of the alignment before us vis a vis ourselves.  
	    Possible Values:
	    MAF_INVERSE_STATUS	'V'
	    MAF_INSERT_STATUS	'I'
	    MAF_DUP_STATUS		'D'
	    MAF_NEW_STATUS		'N'
	    MAF_CONTIG_STATUS	'C'
            
    leftLen - length related information for the previous alignment for the species
    rightStatus - the syntenic status of the alignment after us vis a vis ourselves 
	     Possible values are same as leftStatus.
    rightLen - length related information for the following alignment for the species 

'q' Lines

The q lines are optional.  They are used to display quality data for a
sequence.  Like the i lines, q lines follow the s line that it describes.
The q lines contain the following fields:
    src - The name of one of the source sequences for the alignment.
          This should match the s line above the q line.
    quality - The quality data for corresponding to the sequence on the s line.

As we are generally interested in bases with low quality, the quality
data in the maf is a compressed version of the actual quality data.
The quality data in the maf is:

    min( floor(actualy quality value/5), 9)

This allows us to show more of the low-quality values.  The relationship
between quality characters in the maf and the actualy quality value are
summarized in the following table:

    .: In Gap Q == FAKE_GAP_QUAL
    0: 0 <= Q < 5 || Q == 98
    1: 5 <= Q < 10
    2: 10 <= Q < 15
    3: 15 <= Q < 20
    4: 20 <= Q < 25
    5: 25 <= Q < 30
    6: 30 <= Q < 35
    7: 35 <= Q < 40
    8: 40 <= Q < 45
    9: 45 <= Q < 98
    F: Q == 99

'e' Lines

The 'e' lines are optional and indicate that there isn't aligning 
DNA for a species but that the current block is bridged by a chain 
that connects blocks before and after this block.

  src -- The name of one of the source sequences for the alignment. 
  start -- The start of the non-aligning region in the source sequence. 
      This is a zero-based number. If the strand field is '-' then this is 
      the start relative to the reverse-complemented source sequence. 
  size -- The size in base pairs of the non-aligning region in the 
      source sequence. 
  strand -- Either '+' or '-'. If '-', then the alignment is to the 
      reverse-complemented source. 
  srcSize -- The size of the entire source sequence, not just the parts 
      involved in the alignment. alignment and any insertions (dashes) 
      as well. 
  status -- A character that specifies the relationship between the 
      non-aligning sequence in this block and the sequence that appears 
      in the previous and subsequent blocks. 

The status character can be one of the following values: 

  C -- the sequence before and after is contiguous implying that this 
      region was either deleted in the source or inserted in the 
      reference sequence. The browser draws a single line or a '-' 
      in base mode in these blocks. 
  I -- there are non-aligning bases in the source species between 
      chained alignment blocks before and after this block. The 
      browser shows a double line or '=' in base mode. 
  M -- there are non-aligning bases in the source and more than 95% 
      of them are Ns in the source. The browser shows a pale yellow bar. 
  n -- there are non-aligning bases in the source and the next aligning 
      block starts in a new chromosome or scaffold that is bridged by 
      a chain between still other blocks. The browser shows either a 
      single line or a double line based on how many bases are in the 
      gap between the bridging alignments. 

'r' Lines

The r lines are optional.  They specify how this region of the
MAF was defined.  A paragraph can only have one r line.  The
first word defines the source type, with the remanded of the
words specific to the source type.  The following source types
are defined:

   txupstream - Gene transcription start upstream regions:
           r txupstream size geneId
       size - is the number of bases in the region
       geneId - gene identifier for the gene
