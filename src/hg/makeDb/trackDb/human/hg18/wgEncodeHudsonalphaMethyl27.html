<h1> HudsonAlpha Methylation27 </h1>
<a name="Description"></a><h2> Description </h2>
<p>These
tracks display the methylation status of specific CpG dinucleotides in the
given cell types as identified by Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation27 BeadArray platform. The Methyl27K platform uses bisulfite
treated genomic DNA to assay the methylation status of specific CpG
dinucleotides. Genomic DNA treated
with sodium bisulfite converts unmethylated cytosine of a CpG dinucleotides
into uracil; methylated cytosines do not get converted.
After bisulfite treatment, the
methylation status of a site is assayed by single base-pair extension with a
Cy3 or Cy5 labeled nucleotide on oligo-beads specific for the methylated or
unmethylated state. A beta value
is calculated by Illumina's Bead Studio software for each CpG target.
This value represents the intensity value
from the methylated bead type divided by the sum of the intensity values from
the methylated and unmethylated bead types for any given CpG target.
</p>
<p>
This
method was used to validate Methyl-seq data generated in collaboration with the
laboratory of Dr. Julie Baker at Stanford University to study methylation and
gene expression changes that occur in human embryonic stem cells before and
after differentiation to definitive endoderm.
Based on the results of these experiments, cut-off beta
values to call "methylated" and "unmethylated" are selected.
Any beta value equal to or greater than
0.6 is considered fully methylated.
Any beta value equal to or less than 0.2 is considered to be fully
unmethylated. Beta values between
0.2 and 0.6 are considered to be partially methylated.
Beta-values are quality filtered and
spots that fall below the minimum intensity threshold are displayed as "NA".
</p>
<p>
Scores associated with each site are beta value multiplies by 1000. Methylation
status are color-coded as:
<ul>
<li>red = methylated</li>
<li>purple = partial methylated</li>
<li>bright blue = unmethylated</li>
<li>black = NA</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The
data sets we submit are in a tab-delimited format with Illumina CpG Identifier,
chromosome number, genomic coordinate, gene symbol for the nearest gene, and
beta value for each cell line, and we perform the experiment for two replicates
for each cell line. Detailed
information for the CpG targets are on Illumina's website:

<a name="Methods"></a><h2> Methods </h2>
<p><b> Isolation of genomic DNA </b>
</p>
<p>Genomic
DNA is isolated from biological replicates of each cell line by using the
QIAGEN DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit according to the instructions provided by
the manufacturer. DNA
concentrations and a level of quality of each preparation is determined by UV
absorbance. 
</p>

<p><b> Sodium Bisulfite Conversion </b>
</p>
<p>Bisulfite conversion reaction was done using the
<a href='http://www.zymoresearch.com/protocols/dna/%5BD5003%5D%20EZ-96%20DNA%20methylation%20instruction%20v1.2.pdf'>Zymo Research EZ-96 DNA Methylation<sup>TM</sup> Kit protocol</a>.
One step of the protocol was modified. During the incubation, we included 
a 30 sec 95<sup>o</sup>C denaturing step every hour to increase reaction efficiency as 
recommended by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation27 protocol. 
</p>
<p><b> Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray </b>
</p>
<p>The bead arrays were ran according to the 
<a href="http://www.illumina.com/pagesnrn.ilmn?ID=275">protocol</a> provided by Illumina.
</p>

<b> Processing and analysis software used </b>
</p>
<p>The intensity data from the BeadArray was processed using Illumina's 
BeadStudio software with the Methylation Module v3.2. The data was then 
quality-filtered using p-values.
