 8 (and before) - Getting basic index working to find probable hits.
 9 - Adding DNA sequence to index file.
10 - Starting to work on extending hits into alignments.  No indels seems to work.
11 - Making up a test case generator and some misc.
12 - Got middle two quadrant query insert case working.
13 - Got first quadrant query insert case working.
14 - Got last quadrant query insert case working.
15 - Middle two quadrants of query delete seem to work.
16 - Got last quadrant query insert case working.
17 - Got first quadrant query insert case working.
18 - Made it just output either an insertion or a deletion in the end quadrants, not both.
     Fixed off by one bug fix in last quadrant insert that caused an extra mismatch to be counted.
19 - Refactoring to have an intermediate list of matches in memory.
20 - Making it have tagAlign, maf, and psl output.  (Old style output is gone).
21 - Fixing a couple of bugs that reduced coverage in insert+sub and especially delete+sub
     cases.  Still a small bug (affecting ~2% of cases) in the delete+sub case.
22 - Fixed delete+sub bug. The fix is causing more repeat reporting of matches, which was
     already happening.  Next stop is to fix that.
23 - Fixed duplicate reporting of matches.  Also made it only report best matchings by default
     and only up to a fixed number (default 10) of matches per read.
24 - Fixed bug where when there was more than a single 18-base hit to the index, only the first
     hit was being extended.  Fixed another very subtle bug that was discriminating a little
     too much against insertions vs. substitutions.  Changed minScore option to maxDivergence.
25 - Fixing a bug where it would sometimes output a spurious ^.  Making it open read file 
     (which is quick) before loading index (which is slow) to catch typoes in command line faster.
     Made 25th base in read significant even when maxGap=0.  Fixed reporting bug in number of 
     reads multiply aligned. 
26 - Moving output routines to a separate module.
     Refactoring to make it convert splatTag list to splatAlign list before doing output.
     As part of this the output routines take chains instead of splatTags as input.
27 - Adding in first cut of banded extension.
28 - Making banded extension proceed out from the midpoint of the best block found during
     the tag-mapping phase.  Mostly this is good.  It's definitely good for the 3' end.
     On the 5' end I've mixed feelings, because sometimes now the alignment does not
     go all the way to the start of the read.  
29 - Adding "over" file which contains overused 25-mers, which can speed up search.
     Making hexamer subindex search binary rather than linear.  Should speed up some
     aspects on larger target sets.
30 - Pretty major speed tweak (running in ~2/3 of time it used to) by replacing rbTree with
     a simple list for hits.
31 - Fixed bug in extensions that caused crash on splix files with more than one sequence.
