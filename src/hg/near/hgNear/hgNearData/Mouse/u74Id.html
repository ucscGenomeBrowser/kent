<H3>Description</H3>
<P>This column shows the Affymetrix ID from the U74 series of chips (a, b, and c)
that best corresponds to each gene.</P>

<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Target genome sequences were downloaded from the
<A HREF="http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=mgu74" 
TARGET=_blank>Affymetrix Product Support</A> and mapped to the genome using 
<tt>blat</tt> followed by <tt>pslReps</tt> with the parameters
-minCover=0.3 -minAli=0.95 -nearTop=0.005. For each gene, the target
with the most overlap (on the same strand and excluding introns) was 
selected.
