<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track indicates the location of sequences in publications
mapped back to the genome. Article titles are shown when you move
then mouse cursor over the features. The track is based on the fulltext of
biomedical research articles.  The current data consists of about 600,000 files
(main text and supplementary files) from <A
HREF="http://www.pubmedcentral.com/" TARGET=_blank>Pubmed Central</A>
(Open-Access set) and around 6 million text files (main text) from the
publisher <A HREF="http://elsevier.com">Elsevier</A> (as part of the <A
HREF="http://www.applications.sciverse.com/action/userhome">Sciverse Apps</A>
program). 

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Any filetype was converted to text, including XML, raw ASCII, PDFs and various
office formats (Excel, Word, Powerpoint).  The results were processed with
programs to find groups of words that look like DNA/RNA sequences or
words that look like protein sequences. These are then mapped with BLAT to the
human genome and these model organisms: mouse (mm9), rat (rn4), zebrafish
(danRer6), Drosophila melanogaster (dm3), X. tropicalis (xenTro2), Medaka
(oryLat2), C. intestinalis (ci2), C. elegans (ce6) and yeast (sacCer2).

<UL>
<LI>Hits from the same article that are closer than 30 kbp are
joined into one feature (shown as exon-blocks on the browser)</LI>
<LI>All parts of a joined feature have to match at least 25 bp</LI>
<LI>Non-unique hits are kept in the chain with the most members</LI>
</UL>

The software is available from <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/pubtools/">Google Code</A>.
