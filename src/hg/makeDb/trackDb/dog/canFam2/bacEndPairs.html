<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) are a key part of many 
large-scale sequencing projects.  A BAC typically consists of 50 - 300 kb of
DNA.  During the early phase of a sequencing project, it is common
to sequence a single read (approximately 500 bases) off each end of
a large number of BACs.  Later on in the project, these BAC end reads
can be mapped to the genome sequence.</P>
<P>
This track shows these mappings
in cases where both ends could be mapped.  These BAC end pairs can
be useful for validating the assembly over relatively long ranges.  In some
cases, the BACs are useful biological reagents.  This track can also be
used for determining which BAC contains a given gene, useful information
for certain wet lab experiments.</P>
<P>
A valid pair of BAC end sequences must be
at least 50 kb but no more than 600 kb away from each other. 
The orientation of the first BAC end sequence must be &quot+&quot; and
the orientation of the second BAC end sequence must be &quot;-&quot;.</P>
<P>
The scoring scheme used for this annotation assigns 1000 to an alignment 
when the BAC end pair aligns to only one location in the genome (after 
filtering).  When a BAC end pair or clone aligns to multiple locations, the 
score is calculated as 1500/(number of alignments).</P>
