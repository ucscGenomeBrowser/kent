<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide location analyses were conducted of binding to the 
initiation-complex form of RNA polymerase II (Pol2), 
TATA-associated factor (TAF1), 
acetylated histone H3 (H3ac), 
lysine-4-dimethylated H3 (H3K4me2), 
suppressor of zeste 12 protein homolog (SUZ12), and 
lysine-27-tri-methylated H3 (H3K27me3).
The analyses used chromatin extracted from 
IMR90 (lung fibroblast),
HCT116 (colon epithelial carcinoma),
HeLa (cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma), and
THP1 (blood monocyte leukemia) cells.
The initiation-complex form of Pol2 is associated with the transcription
start site, as is TAF1.  Both H3ac and H3K4me2 are associated with
transcriptionally-active &quot;open&quot; chromatin.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
This annotation follows the display conventions for composite tracks. 
Data for each antibody/cell line pair is displayed in a separate 
subtrack. See the top of the track description page for a complete
list of the subtracks available for this annotation.  The subtracks 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by the list of subtracks.  To display 
only selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to 
hide.  For more information about the graphical configuration options, click 
the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgWiggleTrackHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>Graph
configuration help</A> link.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from each of the four cell lines was separately cross-linked, 
precipitated with antibody to one of the six proteins, sheared, amplified and
hybridized to a PCR DNA tiling array produced at the Ren Lab at UC San Diego. 
The array was composed of 24,537 non-repetitive sequences within the 44 
ENCODE regions. </P>
<P>
For each marker, there were three biological replicates.  Each experiment was 
normalized using the median values. The P-value and R-value were 
calculated using the modified single array error model 
(Li, Z. <em>et al</em>., 2003).
The P-value and R-value were then derived from the weighted average 
results of the replicates.</P>
<P>
The displayed values were scaled to 0 - 16, corresponding to negative log 
base 10 of the P-value.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
Each of the experiments has three biological replicates. The
