# NCBI download site, fetch everything into this one directory:

    #	with the machine and password in your $HOME/.netrc file, this
    #	wget command will require no login.  Your $HOME/.netrc file
    #	is set to 'chmod 600 .netrc' to prevent anyone from finding

    #	psLayout is heavy into disk I/O and it brings everything down if

    #	It appears that psLayout wants an ooc file of tile size 10
    #	I tried making one for the whole assembly but it seemed to

    # use the actual repeat masker output for this human assembly as

    # symlinks to the repeat masker out files and name them as expected
    # for blastz.  In this case they are called notInHuman but they

# VAR_MULTIZ HG17/MM5/RN3/GALGAL2/FR1 (acs 2004-08-12)

# This is a new, experimental version of multiz written by Minmei at
# PSU and sent by e-mail from Webb.  This version allows for a
# progressive alignment strategy (i.e., alignment construction in a
# post-order traversal of the tree) using only pairwise alignments of
# each sequence with the reference sequence and without any need for
# "staging".  Here's a little blurb about it from the header of
# var_multiz.v3.c.

#  var_multiz.v3.c
#
#  Variant to multiz program. It aligns two files of
#  alignment blocks where top row is always the reference,
#  assuming blocks are increasing ordered based on the
#  start position on the refernece seqence. Single-coverage
#  on reference is required at this stage.
#
#  Four arguments are required: char* arg1, char* arg2,
#  int arg3, int arg4. arg1 and arg2 are two files need
#  to be aligned together. The alignment of reference in
#  two files are either fixed or not, determined from
#  argurments arg3 and arg4. arg3 and arg4 are either 1
#  or 0, but cannot be 1 at the same time. 1 means
#  reference is fixed. v1 and v2 cannot be both 1.
#  ...

#  RETROGENE TRACK data update - Robert - 2005-04-08
   (added by Jen 2006-01-31)
   - pushQ entry did not include psuedoMrna table. Old table is still
     present on RR. New data has since been lost on dev. 
     User impact: ~1000 sequence missing links in browser 
   - new all.joiner rule needed to link psuedoMrna to pseudoGeneLink table
   - current all.joiner rule between knownGene to pseudoGeneLink gives errors.
     the data types appear to be mismatched. pseudoGeneLink.kgName is
     a gene symbol, not the same identifier as in knownGene.name
   - data is to be regenerated soon and errors corrected at that time

# BUILD BioCyc TABLES (DONE 10/1/04 Fan)

  - Create bioCycMapDesc table.

	CREATE TABLE bioCycMapDesc (
  	mapID varchar(40) NOT NULL default '',
  	description varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  	KEY mapID (mapID)
	) TYPE=MyISAM;

  - Crate bioCycPathway table.

	CREATE TABLE bioCycPathway (
  	kgID varchar(40) NOT NULL default '',
  	geneID varchar(40) NOT NULL default '',
  	mapID varchar(40) NOT NULL default '',
  	KEY kgID (kgID),
 	KEY geneID (geneID),
  	KEY mapID (mapID)
	) TYPE=MyISAM;

  Using data files sent by Peter Carp from SRI,
  per Peter's email of 10/1/04, they don't have recent update,
  so data files received last year are used.
  
  Save the BioCyc Pathway name and description table as names.txt.
  Save the pathway data file as gene-pathway.dat.
  Make sure there is no extra ^M at end of the lines.

  hgsql hg17 -e	'LOAD DATA local INFILE 'names.txt' into table bioCycMapDesc'

  Run hgBioCyc program to generate the file bioCycPathway.tab.

	 hgBioCyc gene-pathway.dat hg17

  Load into hg17.
 
	 hgsql hg17 -e 'LOAD DATA local INFILE "bioCycPathway.tab" into table bioCycPathway'

# EvoFold is a new comparative method for predicting functional RNA
# secondary structures based on multiple sequence alignnments. The
# predictions generated for the EvoFold track are based on the most
# conserved elements of the 8-way alignment (multiz8way). The current
# data is the result of a pilot study (ongoing research of mine), the
# procedure used to generate the data will therefore be simplified
# when forthcoming evofold tracks for other organism are made. The
# documentation therefore skips the actual data generation, and
# instead starts with a data file I provide.

# PHASTCONS CONSERVATION (2006-01-05 kate)
# Redone when multiz redone to fix overlaps (2006-04-12)
# This process is distilled from Hiram and Adam's experiments
# on mouse (mm7) 17way track.  Many parameters are now fixed, without
# being experimentally derived, either because the experiments
# were lengthy and produced similar results, or because they
# weren't runnable given the alignment size.
# These parameters are:
# --rho
# --expected-length
# --target-coverage
# Also, instead of generating cons and noncons tree models,
# we use a single, pre-existing tree model -- Elliot Margulies' model 
# from the (37-way) ENCODE alignments.
#
# NOTE: Redone 3/20/06, adding rheMac2 to non-informative options,
#       by recommendation of Adam Siepel, to correct unwanted
#       high conservation in regions with primate-only alignments

    # NOTE: reusing cluster-friendly chrom fasta files created earlier
    #cd /cluster/data/hg17

    # Split chromosome MAF's into windows and use to generate
    # "sufficient statistics" (ss) files for phastCons input
    # NOTE: as the SAN fs has lotsa space, we're leaving these
    # big (temp) files unzipped, to save time during phastCons run.
    # Note also the larger chunk sizes from previous runs -- this
    # reduces run-time on the split, slows down the actual phastCons
    # enough so jobs don't crash (jobs are very quick, just a minute
    # or so), and according to Adam, will produce better results.
    # The previous small chunks were probably required by
    # the phyloFit step, which we are no longer using for the
    # human alignments.

# Data is missing chromEnd.  I am setting chromEnd = chromStart + 1 as a

# Solution is to interpolate range but remove gaps.

## ****************************************
# This is a bad assumption about the data format -- here is a description.
## ****************************************
# The recombination rates are for the regions _between_ snps, so these
# files need to be processed slightly differently.  For each line i in
# the file (except the header and the last line), the recombination
# rate is for the position on the current line minus 1 [pos(${i})-1] to
# the position on the subsequent line [pos({$i+1})].  The precision is
# a bit obnoxious and can be truncated to 3 or 4 significant figures.
# (Note that the recombination rate on the last line is 0, as this is a
# placeholder.)  Here is an example:
#
# > head genetic_map_chr1.txt 
# position COMBINED_rate(cM/Mb) Genetic_Map(cM)
# 45413 2.98182170902573 0
# 72434 2.08241435350679 0.0805718043995841
# 78032 2.08135840137317 0.0922291599505152
# 244859 2.88844902005393 0.439455937976397
# 604461 2.88749757426825 1.47814798248583

# 605296 2.88389196108775 1.48055771638249
#
### BED format (like a bedGraph)
# chr1 45412  72434  2.982
# chr1 72433  78302  2.082
# chr1 78031  244859 2.081

#added new lsbd BTKbase
#Sequence mismatches were determined by using the position in the reference
#sequence to fetch the sequence affected by the variant.  Then for substitions
#and deletions with the nts deleted listed, the sequence was compared.
#Insertions and large deletions could not be checked.

# hg17 -> hg15 LIFTOVER CHAINS (DONE 7/27/06 Fan)
    # I used a size of 10kb instead of 3kb for the split (blat query) sizes in
    # hg15.  This had a huge affect on the amount of hits in the blat, which
    # then had a huge effect on the amount of chains.  I should also mention 
    # that hg15 chromosomes chr1 and chr2 were split further 
    # into more than a single query file.  This helped a LOT in avoiding

#  xxBlastTab - Help filter out unwanted paralogs  (Galt 2007-01-11)
#
# Background: The xxBlastTab tables are made with a simple blastall 
# (blastp with -b 1) which chooses the best match.  Unfortunately this
# means that if there is no proper match it will still pick something
# even though it's probably not orthologous. This is especially a problem
# in organisms like rat knownGene which has only 30% gene coverage. 
# The strategy here is to filter our xxBlastTab using synteny mappings from
# the chains. This is done by simply taking $db.kg and using /gbdb/$db chains
# and pslMap to lift the genes to the target xx assembly.  Then hgMapToGene
# will find which of those mapped ids have good overlap with xx.knownGene.
# The final mapping is then created by doing an inner join between 
# the traditional xxBlastTab and the mapping table produced above.
# Then simply drop the old table and rename the new table.
#
# We are starting with xxBlastTab tables already built in the usual way with
# blastall/blastp, probably with doHgNearBlastp.pl script.
#
# I created a new utility script called synBlastp.csh since I have to do this
# several times. 
#
# we want to update hg17 for rat and mouse, 
# so check ./hgGeneData/Human/hg17/otherOrgs.ra for current settings
