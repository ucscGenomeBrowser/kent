<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
ENCODE region-wide location analyses of binding to the initiation-complex form
of RNA polymerase II (Pol2), 
TATA-associated factor (TAF1), 
acetylated histone H3 (H3ac), lysine-4-dimethylated H3 (H3K4me2), SUZ12, and
H3K27me3
were conducted using chromatin extracted from 
IMR90 (lung fibroblast),
HCT116 (colon epithelial carcinoma),
HeLa (cervix epithelial adenocarcinoma), and
THP1 (blood monocyte leukemia) cells.
The initiation-complex form of Pol2 is associated with the transcription
start site, as is TAF1.  Both H3ac and H3K4me2 are associated with
transcriptionally active &quot;open&quot; chromatin.</P>

<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>
Data for each antibody is displayed in a separate track
in the UCSC browser. In cases where experiments involve multiple cell types,
the data for each cell line is displayed in an individual subtrack.
The complete set of tracks and subtracks for this annotation includes: 
<UL>
<LI>Pol2 (HeLa, THP1, IMR90, HCT116)</LI>
<LI>TAF1 (HeLa, THP1, IMR90, HCT116)</LI>
<LI>H3ac (IMR90)</LI>
<LI>H3K4me2 (IMR90)</LI>
<LI>SUZ12 (unstimulated HeLa)</LI>
<LI>H3K27me3 (unstimulated HeLa)</LI>
</UL>
The specific antibody against Pol2, 8WG16
from the Abcom catalog, binds specifically to the non-phosphorylated
form of Pol2 which is associated with the pre-initiation complex.

This annotation follows the display conventions for composite 
&quot;wiggle&quot; tracks. The subtracks within this annotation 
may be configured in a variety of ways to highlight different aspects of the 
displayed data. The graphical configuration options are shown at the top of 
the track description page, followed by a list of subtracks.  To display only 
selected subtracks, uncheck the boxes next to the tracks you wish to hide.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
Chromatin from each of the four cell lines was separately cross-linked, 
precipitated with antibody to one of the four proteins, sheared, amplified and
hybridized to a PCR DNA tiling array produced at the Ren Lab at UC San Diego. 
The array is composed of 24,537 non-repetitive sequences within the 44 
ENCODE regions.</P>
<P>
For each marker, there were three biological replicates.  Each experiment was 
normalized using the median values. The P-value and R-value were
calculated using the modified single array error model (Li, Z. 
<em>et al</em>., 2003).
The P-value and R-value were then derived from the weighted average 
results of the replicates.</P> 
<P>
The displayed values were scaled to 0 - 16, corresponding to negative log 
base 10 of the P-value.</P>

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
There were three biological replicates for each of the eight experiments.
