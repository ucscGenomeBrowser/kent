The August 2005 frog (<em>Xenopus tropicalis</em>) whole genome shotgun 
(WGS) assembly version 4.1 was sequenced and assembled by the 
DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).

<H3>Sample position queries</H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of a sequenced 
genomic clone, an mRNA or EST,
a chromosomal coordinate range, or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides examples 
of various types of position queries for the frog genome. See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" 
TARGET=_blank>User's Guide</A> for more information.

<H3>Assembly Details</H3>
<P>
Assembly version 4.1--which was constructed from WGS reads using the JGI 
assembler, Jazz--contains 19,501 scaffolds with an coverage of 7.65X. 
Roughly half the genome is contained in 272 scaffolds, each of at least 1.56  
Mb in length. In this release, some scaffolds showing homology to a known 
prokaryotic contaminant as well as non-cellular or vector contamination have 
been removed by the JGI and placed in a separate directory. The <em>X. 
tropicalis</em> assembly will be improved over the coming year by additional 
sequencing of large insert clones, targeted gap closure, and the incorporation 
of physical and genetic mapping information as it becomes available.
