<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Chemical modifications (e.g., methylation and acetylation) to the histone proteins
present in chromatin influence gene expression by changing how
accessible the chromatin is to transcription. A specific modification of
a specific histone protein is called a histone mark.
This track shows the levels of enrichment of the H3K4Me1 histone mark across the genome as
determined by a ChIP-seq assay.  The H3K4me1 histone mark is the mono-methylation of lysine 4
of the H3 histone protein, and it is associated with enhancers and with DNA regions downstream of
transcription starts.  Additional histone marks and other chromatin associated ChIP-seq data is
available at the

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, this track uses a transparent overlay method of displaying data from a number of cell
lines in the same vertical space. Each of the cell lines in this track
is associated with a particular color, and these colors are relatively light and saturated so
as to work best with the transparent overlay. The color of these tracks
match their versions from their lifted source on the hg19 assembly. The colors are consistent with the
other hg19 lifted tracks located in the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg38&g=wgEncodeReg">ENCODE Regulation</a>
supertrack, with the exception being the DNase tracks, as they were not lifted from hg19 and are
colored to reflect similarity of cell types.

<h2>Data Release Policy</h2>
<p>
Primary ENCODE data produced during the 2007-2012 production phase were subject to a restriction
period.  However, the data here are past those restrictions and are freely available.
The full data release policy for ENCODE is available
<a href="../ENCODE/terms.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
