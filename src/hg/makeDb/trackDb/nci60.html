<p>Expression <a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/nci60/" 
TARGET=_BLANK>data</A> from "Systematic variation in gene expression 
patterns in human cancer cell lines"

cDNA microarrays were
used to explore the variation in expression of approximately 8,000
unique genes among the 60 cell lines used in the National Cancer
Institute's screen for anti-cancer drugs. The authors have provided a
<a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/nci60/supplement.shtml" 
TARGET=_BLANK>web supplement </a>
where more data and experimental description can be obtained. cDNA
probes were placed on the draft human genome using genebank sequences
referenced by the <a href="http://image.llnl.gov/" 
TARGET=_BLANK>IMAGE</a> clone ids. 

<p>The data are shown in a tabular format in which each column of
colored boxes represents the variation in transcript levels for a
given cDNA across all of the array experiments, and each row
represents the measured transcript levels for all genes in a single
sample. The variation in transcript levels for each gene is
represented by a color scale, in which red indicates an increase in
transcript levels, and green indicates a decrease in transcript
levels, relative to the reference sample. The saturation of the color
corresponds to the magnitude of transcript variation. A black color
indicates an undetectable change in expression, while a gray box
indicates missing data.

<h2>Display Options</h2>
This track has filter options to customize tissue types presented and
the color of the display.

<p><b>Combine Arrays: </b> This option is only valid when the track is 
displayed in full. It determines how the experiments are displayed. The
options are:
<ul>
<li><b>Arrays Grouped by Tissue Median: </b> <i>(default)</i> Displays the median of the log ratio scores of all cell lines 
from the different tissue types.</li>
<li><b>Arrays Grouped by Tissue Mean: </b> Displays the mean of the log ratio scores of all cell lines 
from the different tissue types.</li>
<li><b>All Arrays (experiments): </b> Displays the log ratio score for all cell line experiments.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Color Scheme: </b> 
Data are presented using two color false display. By default
the Brown/Botstein colors of red -> positive log ratio, green -> negative log ratio are used.
However, a yellow/blue option can be selected for those who are colorblind.
