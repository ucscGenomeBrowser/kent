<H2>Description</H2>

<P>
This track contains information about a subset of the
single nucleotide polymorphisms
and small insertions and deletions (indels) &mdash; collectively Simple
Nucleotide Polymorphisms &mdash; from
<A HREF="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/" target=_blank>dbSNP</A>
build 151, available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/organisms" target=_blank>ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp</A>.
Only SNPs that have a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 1% and
are mapped to a single location in the reference genome assembly are
included in this subset.  Frequency data are not available for all SNPs,
so this subset is incomplete.
Allele counts from all submissions that include frequency data are combined
when determining MAF, so for example the allele counts from
the 1000 Genomes Project and an independent submitter may be combined for the
same variant.
</p>
<p>
dbSNP provides
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/VCF/"
target=_blank>download files</a>
in the
<a href="https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.1.pdf"
target=_blank>Variant Call Format (VCF)</a>
that include a "COMMON" flag in the INFO column.  That is determined by a different method,
and is generally a superset of the UCSC Common set.
dbSNP uses frequency data from the
<a href="http://www.internationalgenome.org/" target=_blank>1000 Genomes Project</a>
only, and considers a variant COMMON if it has a MAF of at least 0.01 in any of the five
super-populations:
<ul>
  <li>African (AFR)</li>
  <li>Admixed American (AMR)</li>
  <li>East Asian (EAS)</li>
  <li>European (EUR)</li>
  <li>South Asian (SAS)</li>
</ul>
In build 151, dbSNP marks approximately 38M variants as COMMON; 23M of those have a
global MAF < 0.01.  The remainder should be in agreement with UCSC's Common subset.
</p>
<P>
The selection of SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 1% or greater
is an attempt to identify variants that appear to be reasonably common
in the general population.  Taken as a set, common variants should be
less likely to be associated with severe genetic diseases due to the
effects of natural selection,
following the view that deleterious variants are not likely to become
common in the population.
However, the significance of any particular variant should be interpreted
only by a trained medical geneticist using all available information.
