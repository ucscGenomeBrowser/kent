<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
These tracks contain pseudogene predictions and their parents as identified by PseudoPipe.
<a href="http://pseudogene.org/pseudopipe/" target="_blank">PseudoPipe</a> is a homology-based
computational pipeline that can search a mammalian genome and identify pseudogene sequences
comprehensively and consistently.
</p>
<p>
Pseudogenes are genomic sequences that bear similarity to specific protein-coding genes, but  are
unable to produce functional proteins due to the existence of frameshifts, premature stop codons, or
other deleterious mutations. They arise from gene duplication or retrotransposition events and are
important resources in understanding the evolutionary history of genes and genomes.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>

<p>This composite track consists of two subtracks: the <b>Pseudogenes</b> track and the <b>Pseudogene
Parents</b> track. The <b>Pseudogene Parents</b> track displays parent genes and pseudogenes
labeled with their <a href="https://www.hugo-international.org/standards/" target="_blank">HUGO</a>
IDs, which were derived from Ensembl gene IDs provided by the <a href="https://www.gersteinlab.org/"
target="_blank">Gerstein lab</a> after dataset creation. It includes indicators for pseudogenes. 
These indicators do not show pseudogene locations directly but instead indicate how many pseudogenes
are associated with each gene and link to their genomic regions in the Pseudogenes track.</p>
<p>
The <b>Pseudogenes</b> track shows pseudogenes labeled with their parent HUGO ID and colored
according to pseudogene type. The authors assigned PGOHUMG IDs to genes and PGOHUMT IDs to
transcripts. <b>Note</b>: Not all PseudoPipe IDs could be mapped back to their original Ensembl
IDs. In these cases, the gene ID is listed as NA.</p>

<b>Pseudogene types:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Unspecified pseudogenes</b> include pseudogenic fragments and protein/chromosome homologies
	with high sequence similarity but are too decayed to be reliably classified as processed or
	duplicated.</li>
<li><b>Processed pseudogenes</b> (retrotransposed pseudogenes) result from the reverse
	transcription of mRNA into DNA, which is then inserted into the genome. These pseudogenes
	lack introns, often have small flanking direct repeats, and may retain a 3' polyadenine
	tail. PseudoPipe distinguishes them from duplicated pseudogenes by a combination of these
	features, with the emphasis on the evidence of ancient introns.</li>
<li><b>Unprocessed pseudogenes</b> (duplicated pseudogenes) arise from genomic DNA duplication or
	unequal crossing-over. They often retain the original exon-intron structures of the
	functional genes, although sometimes incompletely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pseudogene Parents track</h3>
<p>Each parent gene is shown with associated pseudogenes represented as grey blocks. These blocks
do not reflect actual pseudogene locations but rather indicate the count of pseudogenes linked to
the gene.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#800080">purple</font></b> - <b> parent gene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#A9A9A9">grey</font></b> - <b> pseudogene indicators </b></li>
</ul>

<p>
If a parent gene has four grey blocks beneath it, this indicates the presence of four pseudogenes
elsewhere in the genome. Hovering over an item displays the gene type, ID (Ensembl transcript ID
or PseudoPipe transcript ID), and the genome position of the gene or pseudogene, with a link to
that genomic region.
</p>

<h3>Pseudogenes track</h3>
<p>Pseudogenes are colored by type.</p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#FF8C00">orange</font></b> - <b> unspecified pseudogene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#0000FF">blue</font></b> - <b> unprocessed pseudogene </b></li>
<li><b><font color="#556B2F">olive green</font></b> - <b> processed pseudogene </b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hovering over a pseudogene item shows the pseudogene type, parent HUGO gene symbol, and the Ensembl
parent transcript ID, which links to the genome position of the parent gene.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
The PseudoPipe pipeline identifies pseudogenes through a series of steps. It first uses BLAST to
rapidly cross-reference potential parent proteins against the intergenic regions of the genome. The
resulting raw hits are then processed by removing redundancies, clustering neighboring sequences,
and aligning each cluster with a unique parent gene. Finally, pseudogenes are classified based on a
combination of criteria, including homology, intron-exon structure, and the presence of stop codons
or frameshifts. This method is designed to detect pseudogenes that are unable to be translated into
proteins.</p> 
<p>
These tracks were generated using a Bash script that processes a GTF file with pseudogene
annotations by removing duplicates, correcting overlapping exons, and converting the data to BED
format with pseudoPipeToBed.py. This script extracts gene and transcript IDs, merges overlapping
exons, assigns colors based on pseudogene type, and outputs a BED file with gene and parent
annotations. PseudoPipeParents.py then links pseudogenes to their functional genes by determining
parent gene coordinates, updating pseudogene entries with interactive browser links and generating a
parent BED file. The final data are formatted into pseudoPipePgenes.bb and pseudoPipeParents.bb BigBed
files. The <a href="https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/doc/hg38/pseudogenes.txt"

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a> or the
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>.
The data may also be explored interactively using our
<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/api.html">REST API</a>.</p>
<p>For automated download and analysis, the genome annotation is stored at UCSC in bigBed files
that can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/pseudogenes/" target="_blank">download server</a>.
Individual regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool
<tt>bigBedToBed</tt> which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system.</p>
<p>
Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain only features within a given range, e.g.</p>
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/$db/pseudogenes/pseudoPipePgenes.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=10000000 stdout</tt>
