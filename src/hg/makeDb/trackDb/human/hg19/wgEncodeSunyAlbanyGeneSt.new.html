<H2>Description</H2>
<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Project.
This track displays transcriptional fragments associated with RNA binding proteins in different
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">cell lines</A>
using RIP-Chip (Ribonomic) profiling on Affymetrix GeneChip&reg; Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
The <i>RBP Assoc RNA</i> view shows the genomic location of transcripts
associated with the array probes.
Data for this track was produced as part of the
<A TARGET=_BLANK HREF="/ENCODE/index.html">
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project</A>.

</P>


<P>In eukaryotic organisms, gene regulatory networks require an additional
level of coordination that links transcriptional and post-transcriptional
processes. Messenger RNAs have traditionally been viewed as passive
molecules in the pathway from transcription to translation. However,
it is now clear that RNA-binding proteins play a major role in
regulating multiple mRNAs in order to facilitate gene expression patterns.
These tracks show the associated mRNAs that co-precipitate with the
targeted RNA-binding proteins using RIP-Chip profiling.
</P>


<H2>Display Conventions and Configuration</H2>
<P>This track has multiple subtracks that display individually in the browser.
The subtracks within this track correspond to different antibodies/target
proteins tested in different cell lines. This track is initially released with a single view.

<DT><i>RBP Assoc RNA</i>
<DD> -->
This view shows the genomic location of the mRNA transcripts associated with RNA Binding 
Proteins as determined by the Affymetrix GeneChip&reg; Human Gne 1.0 ST Array probes.
Items are shaded by p-value using the formula (maxPossibleScore-((maxPossibleScore/cutOffValue)*pValue))
so that items with lower p-values (more significant expression levels) are shaded darker.

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>RBP-mRNA complexes were purified from cells grown according to the approved
<A HREF="../../ENCODE/protocols/cell">ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
Antibodies specific to the RNA Binding Protein (RBP) in question were first coated onto protein A/G containing 
magnetic beads and then used to immunoprecipitate the targeted, endogenously-formed mRNP complexes. Antibody-coated
beads were incubated/tumbled with cell lysate overnight in the cold followed by extensive rinsing and subsequent 
purification of associated RNA using Phenol/Chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.
The associated transcripts were identified using GeneChip&reg; Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays.
Arrays were analyzed using Agilent's GeneSpringGX software (version 11.0).
</P>
<P>
Arrays were analyzed a group at a time by applying the Iterative PLIER16 algorithm using quantile normalization.
Probesets whose normalized expression levels (signal value) fell within the  18 to 98 percentile in at least two of the three replicates
were retained for further analysis.  A TTest (T7-Tag and RIP-Input) or a one-way ANOVA (samples and controls)
was applied to these probesets and a p-value cutoff of .05 was applied.  The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate 
algorithm was then applied to generate corrected p-values, also known as q-values.
</P>

<P>
The RIP-Input was summarized first and selected probesets were retained for further analysis.
 Next, the arrays for T7Tag (background/negative control) RIPs were summarized with those retained RIP-input probesets.
 Probesets that fit the above criteria for either group (RIP-Input or T7Tag)
were then filtered for those that showed a minimum 2 fold increase of expression in T7Tag versus RIP-Input.
Finally, 
arrays for treatment RIP samples were summarized together with those for RIP-inputs and T7Tag RIPs.   Probesets that fit the above 
criteria for any group (RIP-Input or T7Tag or samples) were
then filtered for probesets that showed a minimum 2 fold increase of expression in treatment over total.
A similar list was produced for probesets showing the same enrichment in the T7Tag RIP set.  Probesets which appeared in both
treatment and negative control at these cutoff stringencies were subtracted from the treatment results as background noise, yielding the final data track.

<H2>Verification</H2>
<P>
All experiments (including controls) performed in and analyzed as triplicates.

<H2>Release Notes</H2>
<P> Release 2 (August 2011) of this track corrects the error in the calculated P and Q values. They are now -log<sub>10</sub>(P) and -log<sub>10</sub>(Q).
