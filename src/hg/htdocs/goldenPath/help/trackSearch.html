				The Genome Browser's Track Search feature allows users to find and
				display tracks of interest quickly and easily.</p>
				<p>
				<font size="4"><b>Searching</b></font></p>
				The track search feature provides users with two search options,
				"Search" and "Advanced." If multiple terms are entered, only tracks
				with all terms will be part of the results. We do not currently
				support either/or searching (e.g. a OR b).</p>
				<p>
				<b>Search tab</b>: 
				"Search" is the default tab of the track search feature.
				To search for a track, enter search terms into the box and
				click search. This search looks for the user's terms in the track
				names, descriptions, groups, and metadata. Metadata is
				information, such as cell line, experiment type, and treatment,
				about ENCODE data.</p>
				<p>
				<b>Advanced tab</b>: 
				The "Advanced" tab allows users to search for terms in a specific
				aspect of the track (e.g. the track name, the description, and the
				track group) and can be especially helpful for finding ENCODE tracks
				by setting specific criteria in the "ENCODE terms" section of this
				tab.
				<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>ENCODE terms</b> (not available in all assemblies): This section of the Advanced tab allows users
				to further refine their search for ENCODE tracks using ENCODE
				metadata. By default, there are two rows of ENCODE metadata
				search criteria, but more can be added by clicking the "+" button.
				To remove an added metadata search row, click the "-" button. Each
				row is comprised of two drop-down menus, the first contains the
				metadata categories available, and the second contains the possible
				metadata terms in that category. Because these metadata drop-downs
				are assembly dependent, the options may vary from assembly to
				assembly. Some categories have a link to the far right of the row if
				there is more information available about the terms.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
                                <font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>
				<p>
				After clicking the "Search" button, the first 100 tracks that meet
				the search criteria are displayed.</p>
				<p>
				<b>Check-box/Visibility</b>: Tracks that are currently being
				displayed in the browser will have their check-box selected. To
				turn tracks on or off, select or deselect the associated check-box.
				To turn all tracks listed on the current results page on or off,
				click the "+" or "-" button at the top of the column. By default,
				selecting the check-box of a track turns the track to pack as long
				as pack is a valid view mode of the track. If it isn't, the track is
				set to full or show. Once the check-box of a track is selected, the
				visibility can be changed using the drop-down menu in the visibility
				column.</p>
				<p>
				<img src="../../images/folderWrench.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				This icon designates "container tracks" that can be configured by
				clicking the icon. Container tracks don't have data themselves;
				instead, they contain other tracks that do have data.
				Examples of container tracks are composite tracks, which have a
				light orange background in the search results, and super-tracks,
				which have a tan background; tracks that
				contain data have a yellow background. While
				tracks within a container track may show up in the search results
				and can be configured from the search results page, this isn't
				always the case. Clicking
				<img src="../../images/folderWrench.png" /> opens the container track
				configuration page, allowing the all the tracks within the container
				track to be viewed and configured.
				Please note, since container tracks don't have data of their own,
				turning one on via track search may result in no additional tracks
				in the browser. If this occurs, it is because none of the tracks
				within the container were turned on.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Track information</b>: To find out more information about a
				track, click on the Track Name. The description of the track or the
				container track will pop-up. Click "x" at the top of the pop-up or
				the "OK" at the bottom to close it.
				For tracks that have metadata, mainly ENCODE tracks at this time,
				there is a "..." link on the right-hand side of the track result
				row. Clicking this link expands the row to show the track's
				metadata.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Sorting</b>: By default, resulting tracks are listed in order
				of relevance. However, in the blue header of the results list, 
				the sort order can be changed by selecting one of the other radio
				buttons, "Alphabetically" or "by Hierarchy" (super-tracks listed
				first, then composite tracks, and then data tracks).</p>
				<p>
				<b>Return to Browser/View in Browser</b>: The "Return to
				Browser" button indicates that no tracks have been turned on or off.
				Clicking on the button returns the user to the browser. Once any
				track is turned on or off using the check-boxes, the button label
				changes to "View in Browser" (indicating changes have been made),
				and clicking on the button takes the user to the browser with the
				new track selections displayed.</p>
