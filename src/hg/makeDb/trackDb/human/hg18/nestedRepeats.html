<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track shows joined fragments of interrupted repeats extracted
from the output of the <a href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/" target="_blank">
RepeatMasker</a> program which screens DNA sequences
for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences using the
<a href="http://www.girinst.org/repbase/update/index.html" target="_blank">
Repbase Update</a> library of repeats from the
<a href="http://www.girinst.org/" target="_blank">Genetic
Information Research Institute</a> (GIRI). Repbase Update is described in
Jurka (2000) in the References section below.
</p>

<p>
The detailed annotations from RepeatMasker are in the RepeatMasker track.  This
track shows fragments of original repeat insertions which have been interrupted
by insertions of younger repeats or through local rearrangements.  The fragments
are joined using the ID column of RepeatMasker output.
</p>

<p>
Note that this track was created using a version of RepeatMasker from Nov. 2005
along with Repbase Update 9.11.  In hg18, there is also an Intr Rpts 3.2.7 track
which was created in 2009 using a newer version of RepeatMasker and Repbase Update.
All of the hg18 tracks are based upon this original track and not upon the newer
Intr Rpts 3.2.7 track.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
In pack or full mode, each interrupted repeat is displayed as boxes
(fragments) joined by horizontal lines, labeled with the repeat name.
If all fragments are on the same strand, arrows are added to the
horizontal line to indicate the strand.  In dense or squish mode, labels
and arrows are omitted and in dense mode, all items are collapsed to
fit on a single row.
</p>

<p>
Items are shaded according to the average identity score of their
fragments.  Usually, the shade of an item is similar to the shades of
its fragments unless some fragments are much more diverged than
others.  The score displayed above is the average identity score,
clipped to a range of 50% - 100% and then mapped to the range
0 - 1000 for shading in the browser.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
UCSC has used the most current versions of the RepeatMasker software
and repeat libraries available to generate these data. Note that these
versions may be newer than those that are publicly available on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
Data are generated using the RepeatMasker <em>-s</em> flag. Additional flags
may be used for certain organisms.  See the
<a href="../FAQ/FAQdownloads#download16">FAQ</a> for more information.
