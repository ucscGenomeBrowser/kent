<H2>Description</H2> 
This track shows annotated
genes and open reading frames (ORFs) of <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> obtained from the 
Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD).
The data were downloaded from the file<BR>

on 27 Nov. 2003.  This track excludes the ORFs classified as dubious by SGD.  
Clicking on an item in this track brings up a display that synthesizes 
available data on the gene from a wide variety of sources.
