The March 2006 zebrafish (<em>Danio rerio</em>) Zv6 assembly was produced by 
The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in collaboration with the Max Planck 
Institute for Developmental Biology in Tuebingen, Germany, and the Netherlands
Institute for Developmental Biology (Hubrecht Laboratory), Utrecht, The 
Netherlands. 

<H3>Sample position queries</P></H3>
<P>
A genome position can be specified by the accession number of
an mRNA or EST, a scaffold range,
<!-- an Ensembl transcript ID, -->
or keywords from 
the GenBank description of an mRNA. The following list provides 
examples of various types of position queries for the zebrafish genome. Note 
that some position queries (e.g. "huntington") may return matches to the mRNA 
records of other species. In these cases, the mRNAs are mapped to their 
homologs in zebrafish.  See the 
<A HREF="../goldenPath/help/hgTracksHelp.html" TARGET=_blank>User Guide</A> for more help.

<H3>Assembly details</H3>
<P>
The Zv6 assembly consists of 1,626,077,335 bp in 6,653 scaffolds 
(N50 = 1,247,221 bp) with a sequence coverage of approximately 6.5-7x. 
The assembly, which has been tied to the FPC map with data freeze 12 March 2006,
contains 1.02 Gb from 7,615 sequenced clones, 5,994 finished and
1,621 unfinished. Gaps are filled by sequence from the whole genome 
shotgun (WGS) assembly.</P>
<P>
This assembly was constructed using two different strategies. In the first, 
a WGS approach was used.  DNA from 1000 five-day-old Tuebingen embryos was 
used to generate plasmid and fosmid libraries. The libraries were sequenced and the resulting traces were assembled with the Sanger Institute assembler, 
Phusion. The second approach used traditional 
clone mapping and sequencing techniques to produce a higher quality genome 
sequence. BAC libraries were selected and fingerprinted to generate a 
fingerprint contig (FPC) map. From this map, a tiling path was calculated 
that covered the genome sequence clone-by-clone. Clones from this path were 
selected for high quality sequencing and then pieced together to form the 
genome sequence. </P>
<P>
Clone sequences and WGS contigs were then integrated by considering sequence 
alignments, BAC end placements and zebrafish cDNAs and markers. Improvements 
to the integration algorithm allowed the placement of the WGS contigs that 
contained markers, but could not be linked to the FPC contigs. In cases where 
markers from different chromosomes appear on the same contig, priority has been 
given to the Heat Shock Diploid Cross Panel (HS) and the Boston MGH Cross 
Map (MGH). Some of these discrepancies may be attributed to misassemblies, but 
there may also be inconsistencies between the zebrafish marker panels. </P>
<P>
95% of the sequence -- 1,547,299,723 bp including estimated gap sizes -- lies in
scaffolds that are placed on chromosomes 1-25 (linkage groups 1-25) after 
integration of the WGS assembly with the clone sequences. Integration was 
achieved by consideration of a combination of sequence alignment and BAC end 
positions, as well as features such as zebrafish cDNAs and markers. 
15,986,232 bp of the sequence are in 68 scaffolds tied to unplaced FPC contigs; 
63,164,280 bp are in 2,898 NA scaffolds. The WGS assembly consists of 
20,541,433 reads totaling 14,160,626,498 bp, including an additional 
set of 6,882,050 reads from a new library generated from a single Tuebingen 
doubled haploid zebrafish. Reads were clustered using Phusion, and Phrap was 
used to assemble clusters and for consensus generation. The resulting 
247,928 contigs have an N50 size of 20,629 bp. From these, 105,987 scaffolds 
(supercontigs) were created with an N50 size of 687,451 bp.</P>
<P>
The Sanger Institute notes this assembly release is still preliminary. 
Regions where the physical map is incomplete or contains gaps have sequence
with a higher number of misassemblies. Highly variable regions within the 
genome posed assembly difficulties, most likely because the sequences 
originated from different haplotypes. This also results in assembly dropouts
and false duplications. In addition, the regions covered by WGS contigs are 
lower quality sequence.
